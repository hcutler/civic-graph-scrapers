Were thrilled to announce that the theme of Personal Democracy Forum 2016 is The Tech We Need. There are some amazing mainstage talks to look forward to, but were also still filling up the afternoon panel discussions, so if youd like to pitch one you can learn how to do so here.


Writing for Technical.ly Philly, Juliana Reyes digs in on why a civic tech engineer left Philadelphia city government for an adtech firm. To start, the city didnt treat him right, enforcing rigid rules about when and where one can work that discouraged autonomy and creativity, and relegating technologists to a cramped, dark office nicknamed The Fishbowl. The technologist in question, Gabriel Farrell, also complained about changing priorities that come with new political leadership, and hinted at purpose-fatigue when he said, of his new job, Theres something to be said for not having to spend brain waves on the larger moral weight of whatever one is doing.


Writing in Civicist, mySocietys Emily Shaw asks why there is an enormous (no, really enormous) disparity in the number of academic articles about e-government and civic tech. Shaw also clarifies the difference between the two and why on earth e-gov still matters.


Ch-ch-ch-changes: Fast Companys Michael Grothaus interviews Scott GoodsteinCEO of Revolution Messaging, the digital media agency at the heart of Bernie Sanderss social media operationabout how social media campaigning has changed since the 2008 Obama campaign.


Politicos Nancy Scola has a different angle on the Sanders campaign virtual ground game story, looking at the distributed organizing model that puts more campaign volunteers in higher-level organizing positions than in past campaigns. Scola also talks to a Clinton backer and former Obama organizer who expressed doubts about the Sanders model, wondering if theyre getting the highest possible return on their investment in volunteers without a staffer to help them out.


Saving democracy, and having fun, too: Icelands Pirate Party is preparing its election campaign as protesters push for a vote sooner rather than later in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal, Daniel Oberhaus reports for Vice Motherboard. Asta Gudrun Helgadottir, a Pirate Party representative in the Icelandic Parliament, told Oberhaus: Im really excited to see who is going to answer our call when we ask people to join us...Its going to be a real party, not just a political party. This is a chance to fix this broken democracy that we have and maybe it will survive this crisis that democracies all around the world are facing. Were going to have so much fun together, and if [our agenda] goes through, democracy might have some hope in this world.


Remember ZunZuneo? What a crazy story that was. The APs Jack Gillum, one of the reporters of the original story, has an update on how USAID officials counted on the lengthy FOIA process to hold up, while interest died down, unflattering stories that could embarrass the agency.


If historical precedent is followed, Hillary Clinton is not likely to be indicted for using a personal email server to handle classified information, Josh Gerstein writes for Politico.


Albert Wenger, a managing partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, has released a draft of a book entitled World After Capital, which addresses how we should live in a world in which the only scarcity is our attention.

This is civic tech: If you are an open data geek or just someone who wants to understand the intricacies of making open data more relevant and useful in the context of a big city like New York, dont miss Kaela Sanborn-Hums detailed report in the Gotham Gazette on the state of the citys open data portal and Mayor Bill de Blasios Open Data for All plan.


Civicist senior editor Tom Steinberg writes that its time to be honest about civic tech projects that can pay their own way, and those that cant. Not every civic tech project can be a Change.org or a NationBuilder with a clear business model; some simply wont be paid for by the marketplace. He gives two very important reasons: it will stop impactful-but-not-profitable ideas being distorted into impactless-but-possibly-profitable ideas and governments and funders must not be allowed to live with the illusion that theres something magical about civic tech, some voodoo that will allow us to have amazing public goods for zero ongoing public or philanthropic costs.


Joshua Tauberer, the longtime founder and proprietor of GovTrack.us, responds that he agrees with Steinberg, but that it was always his impression that civic techies valued nonprofits over projects (like his) that manage to be self-sustaining by charging fees.


BetaNYC is looking to hire a short-term hackathon manager.


Tech and politics: Hillary Clintons campaign is looking to add more muscle to its social media efforts, shifting longtime Clinton aide Katie Dowd from her position as digital director into a new senior adviser role focused on building Hillary, Bill and Chelsea Clintons online presence, Evan McMorris-Santoro reports for BuzzFeed. Jenna Lowenstein will move from being Dowds deputy to being full-time digital director.


While Donald Trump has a fan base on Reddit, his campaign isnt doing much with it beyond occasionally picking up a social media meme or viral video generated there, John Herrman of the New York Times reports. Some guy named Sifry adds context.


Crypto-wars, continued: Theres classified, and then theres classified, President Obama told Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday in explaining why he didnt believe former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did any damage to U.S. national security in running work emails through her private email server. Theres stuff that is really top-secret, top-secret, and theres stuff that is being presented to the president or the secretary of state, that you might not want on the transom, or going out over the wire, but is basically stuff that you could get in open-source, the President said.


On reading Obamas remarks, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden responded, If only I had known.


TechDirts Mike Masnick eviscerates Senator Richard Burr and Senator Dianne Feinsteins discussion draft of their anti-encryption bill.


Life in Facebookistan: Responding to the Economist magazines cover story depicting Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg as a Roman emperor, Dan Gillmor argues that its time for journalists to stop complaining about the companys growing power and do something about it, offering several steps they can take.


Age of Transparency: Theres a delicious bit of poetic justice buried at the end of Jim Rutenbergs New York Times media column today, which discusses the Panama Papers leak in the context of WikiLeaks and ongoing efforts to shine more light on the secrets of the worlds powerful.

Organizing science: Can a ten-minute conversation with a canvasser at someones door change their mind about a strongly held opinion? A new study by David Broockman and Josh Kalla, published in Science, titled, Durably reducing transphobia: A field experiment on door-to-door canvassing, says the answer is yes. As Brian Resnick explains in Vox, this is a big deal.


The money chase: Dont miss Hal Harveys mea culpa, Why I Regret Pushing Strategic Philanthropy, published in The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Heres how he starts out:
...A major challenge for strategic philanthropy is that it can create delusions of omniscience in many program officers. Instead of reviewing grant proposals, querying experts, synthesizing ideas, and respecting those with years in the field, many program directors and officers become auteurs: They begin to see themselves as the origin of intelligence as well as the arbiters of money. The grant-making business already starts with a deep imbalance of power, with one party wielding the decision-making authority and the other more or less on bended knee. Add the presumption of strategy, and in no time, grant seekers become whipsawed approval-seekers and grant makers become demigodswith all the theocratic arbitrariness that term implies.
 


And in case you think this is original or helpful, check out Ruth McCambridges riposte. As editor-in-chief of the Nonprofit Quarterly shes been criticizing the hubris of so-called strategic philanthropists for a long time.

Government is more likely to open data if it helps other bits and pieces of government, writes Waldo Jaquith in a blog post about the new trend of decentralized government data aggregation.

The founders of Whatsapp announced yesterday that there is now end-to-end encryption on every form of communication they offer, Cade Metz reports for Wired. This makes it impossible for the company to comply with court orders demanding access to the content shared over the service.


Icelands Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson stepped down yesterday in the wake of the Panama Papers leak, which revealed that his family hid millions of dollars worth of bonds in a shell company, Robert Mackey writes for The Intercept. Thousands of protestors have demanded new elections, but the ruling coalition is trying to avoid that scenario as the Pirate Party currently leads in opinion polls.


The director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which coordinated the publication of the Panama Papers stories, has distanced the organization from WikiLeaks, telling Andy Greenberg at Wired that they they have no intention of publishing the full dataset. ICIJ director Gerard Ryle added, Were not WikiLeaks. Were trying to show that journalism can be done responsibly.

This is civic tech: Say hello to Data USA, a free and open source hub for the visualization of U.S. public data, built and launched yesterday by the MIT Media Lab and Deloitte.


Heres U.S. Digital Service co-founder Haley Van Dycks TED Talk about how she and her colleagues are transforming how the government delivers critical services and saving millions of dollars. (If you attended the 2015 edition of our Personal Democracy Forum, you got to see an equally good version of this talk nine months early at one-twentieth the ticket price. Im just saying.)


Related (sadly): It looks like the TSA Randomizer app, which causes an iPad to randomly produce a right arrow or a left arrow to direct people in line at airport security, cost the government close to $50,000, which it paid to IBM, according to this FOIA request from Kevin Burke. [Updated. The $1.4 million number previously cited was a larger contract with IBM which included the randomizer app.]


Congrats to Alexander Howard, longtime Personal Democracy Media friend and sometime contributing writer, who is joining the Sunlight Foundation as a senior analyst.


Tech and politics: Not one of the 2016 presidential candidates stands out when it comes to ensuring that common sense technology and entrepreneurship policy will prevail, Bradley Tusk (Mike Bloombergs 2009 campaign manager) writes in TechCrunch.


Trump watch: An investigation by Politico reporters Kenneth Vogel and Brianna Gurciullo finds that Donald Trump has assembled a privately funded security and intelligence force with a far wider reach than other campaigns private security operations: tracking and rooting out protesters, patrolling campaign events and supplementing [his] Secret Service protection.


Age of transparency: Pressure is building on Icelands Prime Minister to quit, in the wake of stories from the Panama Papers detailing how he and his wife have circumvented laws requiring the disclosure of assets held overseas, as Steven Erlanger reports for the New York Times.


So far, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which is managing the leaked documents, has only been able to identify 211 people with American addresses in the data, but that is only from recent years, not the full 11.5 million files from the leak, Fusions investigative unit, one the of the participants in the reporting, explains. Its worth noting that corporate secrecy in Nevada is even less transparent than the British Virgin Islands, and as longtime Congressional anti-corruption investigator Jack Blum points out, the Panamanian law firm at the center of the leak, Mossack Fonseca had a subsidiary to create American offshore corporations in Nevada.


Brave new world: On May 15th, my house will stop working. My landscape lighting will stop turning on and off, my security lights will stop reacting to motion, and my home made vacation burglar deterrent will stop working. This is a conscious intentional decision by Google/Nest. Thats Arlo Gilbert, writing on Medium about the pending shutdown of his Revolv home automation device. Nest bought Revolv in 2014. Imagine if you bought a Dell computer and Dell then informed you that when your warranty ends your computer will power down. Imagine if Apple put out a new policy that not only wont they replace the device for defects, but they will actually be bricking your phone 12 months after purchase.

Age of transparency: A massive leak of 11.5 million documents spanning 1977-2015 from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca is revealing how hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, including many politicians and their family members, have used anonymous shell corporations to hide their money and nefarious dealings. Among those named: the current leaders of Argentina, Iceland, Saudi Arabia, the Ukraine, the father of the British Prime Minister, and several close associates of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. More than 100 media outlets are working on digging through the trove.


Russian dissident blogger Alexei Navalny tweets, Based on these documents the entire top of the Russian authorities should be in prison.


Calls for a snap election in Iceland in response to the revelations could lead to the election of the Pirate Party, which has been leading in the polls there for months. (Heres Pirate Party co-founder Birgitta Jonsdottir being interviewed  by yours truly last June at Personal Democracy Forum.) More than two percent of the countrys population are signed up for a protest outside the Icelandic Parliament tomorrow.


Here are all the documents that have been released so far, on Document Cloud.


Tech and politics: Buried inside this pre-mortem on the Bernie Sanders campaign, written by Patrick Healy and Yamiche Alcindor for the New York Times, is this damning statement by former Senator Bob Kerrey, arguing that Sanders mishandled the issue of Hillary Clintons emails. The email story is not about emails, Kerrey said. It is about wanting to avoid the reach of citizens using FOIA to find out what their government is doing, and then not telling the truth about why she did. (Kerrey has endorsed Clinton, by the way.)


The White House has finally gotten a technology upgrade, thanks in part to the efforts of David Recordon, formerly of Facebook, Michael Shear reports for the New York Times. He notes, not quite noticing the irony or the revolving door, The Wi-Fi in the Roosevelt Room is finally strong enough to live-stream an event on Facebook.


Trump watch: Here are some new facts about Donald Trumps campaign that you can learn from reading Gabriel Shermans detailed account in New York magazine: Trumps social media director, Dan Scavino, first earned Trumps trust as his golf caddie and has no prior political experience; the campaign has no pollsters, media coaches, speechwriters or focus groups; Trump apparently has dirt on Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News, that he hasnt used; he hired his campaign manager-cum-bouncer Corey Lewandowski on the recommendation of David Bossie of Citizens United; his daughter Ivanka Trump is responsible for his semi-supportive statements about Planned Parenthood; and his email list, built from people who have registered to attend his rallies, is estimated by Lewandowski to be in the millions at this point.


Crypto-wars, continued: The FBI is telling local law enforcement agencies it will help them unlock iPhones, BuzzFeeds Salvador Hernandez reports.


What sharing economy? Airbnb says it is purging its San Francisco site of hosts with multiple listings, Carolyn Said reports for SFGate.com, following a similar move in New York City.

Narrowing the digital divide: The FCC voted yesterday to expand the Lifeline subsidy program for low-income Americans to include broadband service, Jim Puzzanghera reports for the Los Angeles Times. Nearly half of households earning less than $25,000 a year currently lack high-speed internet.


The advocacy organization Free Press issued a press release commending the decision, but added, Much work remains: The FCC needs to devote additional resources to promoting affordable broadband options across the board. Consolidation and the lack of effective competition have left people of all income levels in the United States paying way too much for Internet access. Its a shortcoming that has direct and negative impacts on everyone seeking these essential services. Lifeline is but one tool the FCC can use to address costs. If the agencys primary goal is to get as many people as possible using broadband, it must do more to make all broadband services affordable.


Researchers Chris Benner and Kyle Neering at the University of California Santa Cruz have written a white paper on the subcontracted workers in Silicon Valley, which they describe as the invisible workforce of the tech industry. They found that the number of subcontracting has increased three times as quickly as that of overall Silicon Valley employment in the past 24 years. Of the blue-collar contract workers, 58 percent are black or Latino (compared to only 10 percent of direct tech employees) and the average annual pay for those blue-collar contract industry workers is a mere $19,900 (compared to the average of $113,000 for direct tech employees).

This data firm is working with the World Bank to collect price information in Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria, with plans to expand elsewhere, Hayley Tsukayama reports for the Washington Post. Locals in target areas can share photos of price tags for goods sold in the area, taken with a smart phone, with the data firm, Premise, in exchange for payment, and then Premise aggregates the information to share with clients.


A warrant canary is conspicuously missing from Reddits 2015 transparency report, which was published yesterday, Cyrus Farivar writes for Ars Technica. CEO Steve Huffman commented on a thread about the report, Ive been advised not to say anything one way or the other.


Martin Moore, the director of the Center for the Study of Media Communications and Power in the Policy Institute at Kings College London, has written a hefty paper on the civic power of tech giants, arguing that these powers should be acknowledged and taken into account when crafting policies or regulation.

Civic tech takes on Congress: Were coming to this a bit late, but in this excellent blog post the founder of TechCongress, Travis Moore, shares lessons learned during recruitment of the inaugural class of Congressional Innovation Fellows. Under the assumption that the application would naturally find its way to primarily liberal, white, male technologists, outreach efforts were focused on attracting underrepresented groups: women, minority, LGBT, veteran, and conservative candidates. Consequently, 43 percent of the applicants were from these under-represented groups.
Moore concludes, Congress has a 14 percent approval rating. This election cycle is the most angry and bitter of this, or perhaps several, generations. And many of the Legislative Branchs problems may be intractable for years to come. But with 24 days notice, 213 technologists applied to be an inaugural Congressional Innovation Fellow. There is a strong desire to build and modernize this essential institutionour first branch of government...The tech communitya group of pragmatic and intensely-focused problem solvershas not written off the Congress of the United States.

Republican frontrunner Donald Trump talked foreign policy with Maggie Haberman and David Sanger of The New York Times, and here is what he had to say about Americas capabilities in cyber-warfare, verbatim:
First off, were so obsolete in cyber. Were the ones that sort of were very much involved with the creation, but were so obsolete, we just seem to be toyed with by so many different countries, already. And we dont know whos doing what. We dont know whos got the power, whos got that capability, some people say its China, some people say its Russia. But certainly cyber has to be a, you know, certainly cyber has to be in our thought process, very strongly in our thought process. Inconceivable that, inconceivable the power of cyber. But as you say, you can take out, you can take out, you can make countries nonfunctioning with a strong use of cyber. I dont think were there. I dont think were as advanced as other countries are, and I think you probably would agree with that. I dont think were advanced, I think were going backwards in so many different ways. I think were going backwards with our military. I certainly dont think we are, we move forward with cyber, but other countries are moving forward at a much more rapid pace. We are frankly not being led very well in terms of the protection of this country.
 


Questions about the security of Hillary Clintons private email server appear to be at the heart of the FBIs ongoing investigation, reports Robert OHarrow Jr. for the Washington Post. When Clinton became Secretary of State, she insisted on continuing to use her private Blackberry, even as State Department security officials struggled to find a way to secure it, he reports. But they were never told about her private server and took no steps to protect it against intrusion. In addition to determining what classified material flowed through it, the FBI is also trying to determine if it was hacked. A total of 147 agents have been deployed to run down leads, OHarrow reports.

Meyerson traces the start of the Sanders movement to the efforts of two former Occupiers, Charles Lenchner (a Civic Hall member!) and Winnie Wong, who now run People for Bernie Sanders. Wong, Meyerson notes, came up with the hashtag #FeelTheBern.


On Facebook, Lenchner estimates that with about 200 volunteers, he and Wong have produced about 2 billion impressions of pro-Bernie content on Facebook alone, which he values at about $3 million in digital media value to the campaign.


Democratic grassroots fundraising platform ActBlue gets profiled by Evan Halper in the Los Angeles Times. This is something that the Democrats have that the Republicans somehow still dont, comments David Karpf, of George Washington University (and Civic Hall member). It is critical infrastructure.


A whopping 110 million hours of candidate- and issue-related content has been watched on YouTube this election cycle, Issie Lapowsky reports for Wired.


A petition calling on the Republican National Committee to allow the open carry of firearms at the Quicken Loans Arena during the GOP convention has nearly 7,500 signatures on Change.org, Hamilton Nolan reports for Gawker. (The arena doesnt allow guns on its property.)


According to the Center for American Women and Politics, Gender Avenger and the Womens Media Center, last weeks cable and TV news shows overwhelmingly featured men, with only Anderson Cooper 360 achieving parity in the number of male and female analysts on his program.


Life in Facebookistan: With Facebook CEO continuing to press his charm offensive in China, Josh Horwitz writes for Quartz that a censored, altered, government-friendly version of Facebook is the only way the company will be allowed in by the countrys repressive government.

Tech and politics: Uh-oh. As the Republican national convention approaches and the likelihood of a chaotic floor fight increases, the rival presidential campaigns are starting to focus on finding a killer app to help them track delegates in real-time, Darren Samuelsohn reports for Politico. Given that bandwidth inside the convention arena will likely be overloaded, and real-time tools sometimes fail when stressed (does anyone remember Mitt Romneys Project ORCA?), the old-fashioned methods of tracking (spreadsheets, runners, walkie-talkies) may work best. Though I have to admit, when I first read this storys headlineGOP campaigns hunt for convention killer appI thought it was going to be about whether people will be allowed to bring guns inside, given that Ohio is an open carry state.


With Donald Trump continuing his blatantly misogynistic attacks on Heidi Cruz, Teds wife, Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight offers this electoral map projection of the results if women refuse to vote Trump.


Hillary Clinton is compatible across all platforms. That is, for selfie-taking at rallies, as Rich Smith reports for The Stranger.


After you get past the personal nastiness that is Evgeny Morozovs trademark as a writer and cultural critic, take a look at his substantive critique in The Baffler magazine of former State Department innovation adviser Alec Ross new book, The Industries of the Future. Ross (full disclosure: a longtime friend of Personal Democracy Media) was a leading voice for the Internet Freedom agenda that was an hallmark of Hillary Clintons early tenure at the State Department, but later got dropped after WikiLeaks illustrated the actual limits of the Obama Administrations support for people-powered open government. Morozovs trenchant (and sometimes over-the-top) criticisms of Silicon Valleys hucksterism are already well-known, but in this review he makes a sharp and useful point that youll also find in Douglas Rushkoffs new book Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: for all the talk about disruption, our newly minted tech moguls arent disrupting the most powerful institution of all: Big Finance. Heres how Morozov puts it:
Despite incessant proclamations to the contrary, the purse still wields more power than the cellphone. And given the growing indebtedness of the population and the financializaton of everything under the sun, citizens stand to be further disempowered for the benefit of elites, banks, and transnational institutions. (The latter barely get a mention in Rosss book.) Populism is on the rise across the globe not because citizens feel empowered by new technologies, but because they feel disempowered by everything else. These populist movements might even be putting technologies to good use. But as the Greek experience shows us, while a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin might offer some hypothetical lifeline to a government that subscribes to an alternative political and economic agenda, other mechanisms of powermostly the old-fashioned banking systempreclude its actual deployment.
The Civic Hall book club will be discussing Rushkoffs book, with the author on hand(!), on April 5.


Are you an activist or an organizer? Either way, make the time to read Astra Taylors terrific essay Against Activism, which is also in The Baffler.


What sharing economy? Sharing economy critic Tom Slee describes in Jacobin how well-funded pre-IPO startups like Uber and Airbnb have selectively released data to try to tilt public perceptions in their favor, while investigative reporters are steadily uncovering more disquieting questions about their business practices. More dirty laundry is coming, he predicts.


This is civic tech: Austin city innovation catalyst Angela Hanson recounts how her team, led by Mayor Steve Adler, leaned into the SXSW chaos, pulled a delegation of 18 mayors from around the country to attend, and ran a problem-solving mayor-to-entrepreneur matching-program during the conference that was a showcase for civic tech.

Jessie Daniels reports for our Rethinking Debates project on how a popular Japanese video-sharing site became the first platform for an interactive presidential debate there.

Tech and politics: Bundlers rejoice! Former Obama fundraiser Steve Spinners company RevUp Software is rolling out an algorithm that optimizes high-dollar fundraising by making it easier for people to mine their relationships and discover new potential donors, as Joshua Green reports for Bloomberg. Investors in the company include Pierre Omidyar, Reid Hoffman, and Sean Parker. Green writes:
After a year of beta testing, RevUp recently launched its data analytics software, into which anyonecandidate, staff, volunteer fundraisercan upload a list of personal contacts from Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, or other sources, along with the candidate or cause for which he is raising money. The software then spiders through records aggregated from thousands of public and private websites and databases, checking the names against everything from dozens of public-election databases (such as the Federal Election Commissions), to political groups (the Federalist Society, the Sierra Club), to thousands of charities and nonprofits (Boys & Girls Clubs, the Ms. Foundation for Women), even to colleges and universities. The information this journey yields is rich enough to determine a persons political leanings and even their past support for specific candidates, thus eliminating the possibility of awkward, friendship-wrecking phone calls. What spits out the other end is ones contacts ranked by their ability and likelihood to give, whether or not theyve donated to a campaign before.


Oddly, Spinner thinks that his tool, which sounds like it will indeed make it easier for politicians and bundlers to figure out which people to tap for donations, will reduce the time they spend raising money and allow them to be more civic-minded. Thats like thinking that if you widen a highway, there will be less traffic on it. With RevUp, the arms race for money will just get worse. And politicians will be just as money-minded as before.


Longtime digital strategist Peter Dauo, a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton, says he is planning legal action against people who have been defaming him online.


Trump watch: Asked by Bloomberg Politics about using nuclear weapons against ISIS, Donald Trump says, Im never going to rule anything outI wouldnt want to say. Even if I wasnt, I wouldnt want to tell you that because at a minimum, I want them to think maybe we would use them.... We need unpredictability. We dont know who these people are.


Last night the mudslinging between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz reached another low point, with Trump threatening to spill the beans on Cruzs wife Heidi in response to an anti-Trump online ad (made by Make America Awesome again, a PAC run by Liz Mair) that includes a nude photo of Trumps wife Melania that was originally shot for Britsh GQ in 2000, as Brendan OConnor recounts for Gawker. (The ad is being micro targeted at Mormon women on Instagram, in case you were wondering.)

In the wake of todays terror bombings in Brussels, Facebook has turned on its safety check feature again, David Meyer reports for Fortune. It was also activated in the after attacks in Nigeria and Turkey, he notes.


Heres a useful Twitter list of Brussels officials, curated by Rob Owers, the head of news, government and regional partnerships at Twitter UK.


Crypto-wars, continued: The FBI now says it may have a way to unlock the iPhone at the center of its dispute with Apple, and so it has asked the court to stay its earlier order requiring Apple to do so, David Kravets reports for ArsTechnica.


Malkia Cyril of the Center for Media Justice explains in The Guardian why black Americans have so much at stake in the fight for digital privacy and security, and why several Black Lives Matter activists have joined in Apples fight against the FBI.


Tech and politics: Republican voters in todays Utah primary will be able to vote online, John Breeden reports for NextGov. He writes: How the process will work in Utah is that registered Republican voters can visit a portal and validate themselves using personal information like their name, address and date of birth. A unique PIN is then sent directly to their cellphone or email address, which can be used later to cast their ballot....On the backend, each vote is digitally signed and checked to make sure it corresponds to a registered voter, so no invalid votes can ever be added to the system. Each individual vote is encrypted and given a checksum value so later it can be confirmed that nothing was changed, deleted or otherwise manipulated.


Trump watch: Daniel Drezner reads through Donald Trumps interview with the Washington Post editorial board so you dont have to.


OK, you do have to read this part, where he dodges a question about using nuclear weapons against ISIS but talks for 550 words about the size of his hands.


This is civic tech: Planner and strategist Noel Franus makes a good, if obvious, point about civic innovation: its not just for technologists.

This is the empowered intrepreneur with free range to seek opportunities for innovation and tap into nimble, cross-disciplinary teams to jam on solutions and move quickly to prototype new futures for public services and placemaking.


US CTO Megan Smith cites the updated Cluetrain Manifesto in her conversation with Brian Fung of the Washington Post about how we need to handle online harassment.

One in five women will be attacked or assaulted on campus, one in 20 men. This is not acceptable. And yet its happening in the digital space, too. And its debilitating. So we have to really evolve our culture and its a heavy lift, because its not a digital-only thing; its analog meets digital.

Crypto-wars, continued: The French police have compiled a detailed report on the Paris terror attacks of last November, Rukmini Callimachi, Alissa Rubin, and Laure Fourquet report for the New York Times, but the few details it offers on how the terrorists allegedly conspired using burner phones and encryption left many security experts fuming. They write, According to the police report and interviews with officials, none of the attackers emails or other electronic communications have been found, prompting the authorities to conclude that the group used encryption. What kind of encryption remains unknown...


They also add: One of the terrorists pulled out a laptop, propping it open against the wall, said [a] 40-year-old woman [who was a hostage inside the Bataclan club while it was attacked]. When the laptop powered on, she saw a line of gibberish across the screen: It was bizarrehe was looking at a bunch of lines, like lines of code. There was no image, no internet, she said. Her description matches the look of certain encryption software, which ISIS claims to have used during the Paris attacks.


The ACLUs Christopher Soghoian tweeted, The NYT story on the Paris attackers makes as much (if not more) sense if you replace encryption with magic. And NYU journalism professor Adam Penenberg tweeted, The @nytimes proof that the Paris terrorists used encryption is law enforcement cant locate their emails and a woman saw squiggly lines.


The issue of whether encryption helped the Paris terrorists is so hot it drew The Wire creator David Simon into a friendly but heated debate on Twitter with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, as David Meyer reports for Fortune. Snowden started it by suggesting, sarcastically, that The Wire could be blamed for terrorists use of burner phones. Simon replied by arguing the case for metadata collection, and they were off.


Related: Snowden spoke Saturday in Warsaw at an event by our Personal Democracy Forum Poland co-producers the e-Panstwo Foundation. He called for an international body to arbitrate whistleblower cases.


Rainey Reitman of EFF pens an open letter on the encryption debate to President Obama: This is about math, not politics.


A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins found a security flaw in an older version of Apples iMessage platform, Ellen Nakashima reports for the Washington Post.


Tech and politics: The Bernie Sanders campaign says it has collected more than 5.7 million campaign contributions so far, compared to 2 million for Hillary Clinton, Nicole Gaudiano reports for USA Today. The Clinton campaign just touted hitting its millionth donor, a benchmark Sanders hit at the end of last year. (Clinton strategist Teddy Goff notes that it took the 2008 Obama campaign almost 13 months to hit its millionth donor while Clinton did it in about 11 months.)


Trump watch: The breakdown of the mainstream media has a lot to do with the rise of Donald Trump, argues Jim Gutenberg, the new media columnist for the New York Times. He notes how the cable networks in particular have been unable to resist the ratings that come with their wall-to-wall coverage of the short-fingered vulgarians every utterance.


With Trump addressing the pro-Israel AIPAC lobby today, the Anti-Defamation Leagues new director Jonathan Greenblatt writes, for Time magazine, that the organization is redirecting contributions it has received from Trump over the years into its anti-bias programs. He calls on other groups to follow suit. (Longtime followers of the tech-politics space may recall Greenblatts work as the founder of All for Good, an open-source platform that aimed to aggregate volunteer opportunities online.)


Anonymous has managed to dump a bunch of Trumps personal information online, including his social security number, Marie Solis reports for Mic.com. How this is supposed to help stop him is not explained.


Opponents of Trump might want to consider the arguments of longtime nonviolence advocate George Lakey, who writes more empathy for Trumps supporters, and less confrontational protests, might be the best strategy to blunt his continued rise.


Coming to this late: Network semiotician Valdis Krebs has been mapping the links between political book buyers on Amazon for each presidential cycle going back to 2004, and in this post from January he looks at the relationships among the political books of this cycle, including those by the presidential candidates.

This is civic tech: When you Google a presidential candidate, campaign finance data from the Center for Responsive Politics comes up automatically. As Google product managers Jacob Schoenberg and Payal Patel explain, Finding information on campaign funding can be difficult, if not seemingly impossible. Today, working with one of the most respected data sources in the industry, the Center for Responsive Politics, were making presidential campaign finance information easy to access and understand, right from Google Search. So when you search for donald trump or clinton campaign finance, youll see a snapshot of their campaigns finance breakdown and be able to dig into interesting insights, like the percentage of funds coming from SuperPACs versus individual donations, or which industries have donated the most to a given candidate. Kudos to CRP!


Heres the transcript of President Obamas appearance at SXSW this past Friday. While Obamas remarks on the topic of encryption dominated the news, he also made a strong pitch for the U.S. Digital Services efforts to modernize how the federal government uses technology. Part of my job is to try to institutionalize that over the next several years, he said, adding, And I want to make sure that the next President and the federal government from here on out is in constant improvement mode and were constantly bringing in new talent and new ideas to solve some of these big problems.

Tech and politics: Zack Exley and Becky Bond, two of the digital organizing veterans currently serving as national advisors to the Bernie Sanders campaign, give a long interview in The Nation to some guy named Sifry about their open-source, distributed, Big Organizing model. Says Exley: Our task was to turn massive amounts of enthusiasm into disciplined volunteer teams capable of accomplishing real objectives set forward by the campaign. And we had to do this before a field structure was put in place that was based on the old, less scalable model!....internet-based campaigns tend to fail to achieve their objectives when they cant leverage the full capacity of all the people who raise their hands and say I want to be involved. Its one thing to crowd-source funding for movement organizing. Its another thing to crowd-source the organizing itself and have valuable work get done at scale by tens of thousands of committed volunteers.


The scale produced so far: 60,000 campaign events run by volunteers, 22,000 phonebanks run by volunteers, 600 Barnstorms filled with hundreds of volunteers, hundreds of Slack teams with tens of thousands of members. (One could argue that Slack is actually the breakout tech tool of 2016.)


As of March 13, as Exley and Bond report, the Sanders campaign machine has made 36 million voter contact calls, running at a pace of one million per night for the last few weeks. (In 2012, the Obama campaign said it made 150 million calls and door-knocks over the entire cycle, built on a staff of 4000.)


The other big platform for Sanders organizing is Facebook, where he has about 165 Facebook Pages with 7.3 million likes, and nearly 200 Facebook Groups with more than 358,000 members; Clintons numbers are roughly half that.


When progressives complain that NationBuilder lets anyone use its voter engagement toolset and voter files, ask them how they feel about progressive Democrat Tim Canova who is being denied access to the VAN voter file and database because he is running against an incumbent, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. (And he sure isnt happy about it.)


Raising eyebrows, Chelsea Clinton is headlining a fundraiser for her mothers campaign at the home of Elizabeth Holmes, the embattled founder of blood-testing startup Theranos, Noah Kulwin reports for Re/Code.

Trump watch: Here are some worrisome signs that Trump supporters are starting to talk about bringing guns to rallies and polling places and taking steps towards forming some kind of Trump militia. If you are trying to follow along in the original German or Italian, once Trump starts embracing a para-military to guard his rallies and spread his movement he will have leveled up to full fascist.


Technosociologist Zeynep Tufekci went to Trumps rally in Fayetteville, and she tells Christopher Woolf of PRI, Its almost a text-book case of the rise of an authoritarian populist movement. But, noting a lack of organization at the rally, she adds, the aftermath of the rally made me think, no, this is so dependent on one persons charismatic connection with a crowd, theres no organization behind it. So I dont think hes going to win the presidency.

Marcy Wheeler does a close reading of the governments arguments in the ongoing court battle with Apple and argues that the Department of Justice isnt just trying to compel Apple to write new code to crack the phone, it is also clearly threatening to go after Apples source code.


The British government is pressing forward on its proposed Investigatory Powers bill, which is undergoing its second reading in Parliament now, and Silkie Carlo of Liberty HQ writes that if it passes, The State will be able to read billions of our communications every day...Our internet history will be stored an open to hundreds of public bodies... and encryption will be drastically curtailed.

For example, in many states the actual delegates arent picked by the candidate that they are supposedly pledged to, theyre picked by state conventions or executive committees. Issenberg reports that at Ted Cruzs Houston headquarters, a six-person team overseen by political operatives, lawyers, and data analysts is effectively re-enacting the primary calendar, often with the aim of placing double agents in Trump slates.

This is civic tech: White House chief digital officer Jason Goldman previews President Obamas appearance today at SXSW, where he is going to discuss tech and civic engagement. Calling for more user-centered government, Goldman says, this might be President Obamas most important accomplishment as the First Tech President: establishing a lasting legacy of service that will carry on long after he leaves office. Obamas keynote will stream live at 2:30pm CT.


Also, stay tuned for news of a White House Summit on Civic Engagement, coming later this spring.

This is civic tech: Inspired by a talk by Magdelin Vargas and Chanda Fruchter of NYC 311 that she heard at last Saturdays School of Data, programmer Aliza Aufrichtig built a Chrome extension that shows would-be renters every 311 complaint lodged against the address they are exploring.


Programmer Carlos Pena explains how a data scraping project he build to pull together government information in Peru pertaining to the visitors to government offices is being used by journalists to connect the dots and reveal hidden lobbying and corruption.


Starbucks is partnering with Turbovote in an effort to encourage all of its 150,000 U.S. employees to register to vote, Daniel Lippman reports for Politico. (Kudos to Seth Flaxman, Turbovote co-founder and Civic Hall member!)


Google.org, the companys charitable arm, gives away $100 million a year. Jacquelline Fuller, its director, tells Davey Alba of Wired that its focused on an evidence-based approach to taking bigger risks aimed at bigger impact. She says, Theres big thinking, [while] theres so much incremental thinking in the nonprofit and foundation world. [The foundation world] is so focused on, Fed X number of people today. Can we feed X+1 tomorrow? As opposed to asking: Wheres the path that can get us to X squared?


Big thinks: Odds are, this morning, that your Twitter feed is telling you to hurry up and read Jeffrey Goldbergs new Atlantic cover story on The Obama Doctrine, the presidents approach to foreign affairs. Ill save you some time, because its almost 20,000 words long: Obama has a nuanced view of Americas power to bring order to the world, and hes less of an interventionist than Hillary Clinton.


Obama also has a very interesting observation about the march of human progress, which he applies to the current breakdown in the Middle East, but which could be also read through the lens of current events here in the United States:
I believe that overall, humanity has become less violent, more tolerant, healthier, better fed, more empathetic, more able to manage difference. But its hugely uneven. And what has been clear throughout the 20th and 21st centuries is that the progress we make in social order and taming our baser impulses and steadying our fears can be reversed very quickly. Social order starts breaking down if people are under profound stress. Then the default position is tribeus/them, a hostility toward the unfamiliar or the unknown. Right now, across the globe, youre seeing places that are undergoing severe stress because of globalization, because of the collision of cultures brought about by the Internet and social media, because of scarcitiessome of which will be attributable to climate change over the next several decadesbecause of population growth. And in those places, the Middle East being Exhibit A, the default position for a lot of folks is to organize tightly in the tribe and to push back or strike out against those who are different.


Obama also understands very well the value that civil society brings: Right now, I dont think that anybody can be feeling good about the situation in the Middle East, he said. You have countries that are failing to provide prosperity and opportunity for their people. Youve got a violent, extremist ideology, or ideologies, that are turbocharged through social media. Youve got countries that have very few civic traditions, so that as autocratic regimes start fraying, the only organizing principles are sectarian. Contrast that with Southeast Asia, which still has huge problemsenormous poverty, corruptionbut is filled with striving, ambitious, energetic people who are every single day scratching and clawing to build businesses and get education and find jobs and build infrastructure. The contrast is pretty stark.


Notably: the phrase internet freedom never gets mentioned. Remember when that was a thing the Obama administration cared about? Now, not so much. (Somewhere between the souring of the Arab Spring and the disclosures by Edward Snowden, it got dropped.)


Speaking of big interviews: Nilay Patel has a must-read interview with FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in The Verge. My heart has always been with the insurgents, not the incumbents, he says. He also talks about how he is wrestling with the issue of zero rating, the privacy battle, and able box unlocking. (h/t David Isenberg)


Tech and politics: Internet prankster Dan Sinker wrote a Chrome extension that replaces Donald Trumps name with the words Someone With Tiny Hands. That managed to get onto a computer at Wired magazine and the next thing you know it prompted this hilarious correction (which went viral), plus an explanation from Jason Tanz of Wired.

Tech and politics: Heres one thing Mike Bloombergs decision not to run for President has spared us: VC Chamath Palihapitiya wont be taking a leave of absence from his firm Social Capital to join Bloombergs team. Thats one aspect of the aftermath of Bloombergs non-run, as Issie Lapowsky reports for Wired. (Palihapitiya, you might recall, once declared that the functional value of the government is effectively discounted to zero [and]....If the government shuts down, nothing happens and we all move on, because it just doesnt matter. Stasis in the government is actually good for all of us.


Had Bloomberg run, his political adviser Bradley Tusk says his campaign would have taken a very tech-centric approach, including paying sharing economy drivers and delivery people to be their field staff, campaigning for Bloomberg as they went about their routes, Lapowsky reports. Tusk told her, Rather than advertising on Craigslist, which is what normally happens, we said: These people are already organized. They already exist. Theres a rating in terms of their ability to do well with other people. It would have been really interesting. Several sharing economy companies had bought into the idea, supposedly.


The first serious Jewish candidate for president appears to have won the Muslim voteat least in Dearborn, Michigan, where last night Bernie Sanders was ahead 2-1. To add some additional poetry: were talking about anti-Semite Henry Fords old stomping grounds, as @JewsforBernie points out.

This is civic tech: The White House has launched The Opportunity Project, with a focus on making local and federal datasets easily sortable and available online, so developers can combine them to build new civic tech tools to improve the relationship between cities and their citizens, as Issie Lapowsky reports for Wired. According to U.S. chief data scientist DJ Patil, the idea for the effort came from President Obama, who will talk more on the topic of tech and government at SXSW this weekend.


The projects website is a civic tech playhouse, with several new projects showcased that make innovative use of open government data to help people navigate their communities more effectively, including a tool from Redfin showing users nearby jobs they can get to without a car and a tool from Azalea showing transit access to community resources like day care, health care, Head Start, playgrounds and recreation centers. (This veritable flood of new platforms bears watchingwill these shiny new sites get traction?)


Perhaps most interesting to hard-core open data and civic tech nerds: The Opportunity Project comes with an open-to-the-public Slack channel. Ross Dakin, one of the White House Presidential Innovation Fellows working on the project says, You have to go where your users areyou have to use tools that people are already using. (This is not a government-first, by the way: 18F has a public Slack here.)

Life in Facebookistan: Columbia Universitys Emily Bell takes to the Columbia Journalism Review to sum up a message shes been honing for the last few years: Facebook (and the social media ecosystem) have swallowed journalism, causing news publishers to lose control over distribution and radically undermining the power of what used to be known as the Fourth Estate. The result is a situation where independent publishing either dies or turns to advertorialism to make money. She writes:
There are huge benefits to having a new class of technically able, socially aware, financially successful, and highly energetic people like Mark Zuckerberg taking over functions and economic power from some of the staid, politically entrenched, and occasionally corrupt gatekeepers we have had in the past. But we ought to be aware, too, that this cultural, economic, and political shift is profound. We are handing the controls of important parts of our public and private lives to a very small number of people, who are unelected and unaccountable.
 


Tech and politics: The autocratic billionaire haunting the 2016 presidential election has decided not to run. And as Maggie Haberman and Alexander Burns report for the New York Times, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg had spent months and untold millions getting ready to jump in. His aides covertly assembled several dozen strategists and staff members, conducted polling in 22 states, drafted a website, produced television ads and set up campaign offices in Texas and North Carolina, where the process of gathering petitions to put Mr. Bloombergs name on the ballot would have begun in days.

This is civic tech: Lisa Abeyta of AppCityLife writes for Inc. about the University of Chicago MBA course on entrepreneurship for urban innovators, a lab class aiming to help train the next generation of civic tech makers and doers. (One quibble: this isnt the first university-level course on this topic. Off the top of my head: In 2012 Susan Crawford taught Solving Problems Using Technology at the Harvard Kennedy School; Columbia Universitys School of International and Public Affairs has been offering Technology and the Future of Governance and Public Policy taught by Ari Wallach and Hollie Russon Gilman for the last two years; and NYUs Center for Urban Science and Progress and The GovLab (NYU and MIT) have both been offering degrees in the field for several years.)


Writing for the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Alexandra Christy does an excellent job explaining the 18F process.

Speaking of 18F, this blog post from Colin MacArthur, Carolyn Dew, Michelle Chorister, and John Yuda on what they are learning as they flesh out the plan for the Federal Front Door project is absolutely fascinating.

Worse, Satarianos editors smacked an obnoxious headline on his story: The Antiwar Activist Who Helped Make Donald Trump Possible. This, from a publication whose owner, Mike Bloomberg, is a possible candidate for president but wont allow the journalists who work for him to cover his own personal life or wealth. Were with Gilliam, who says, the right to organize is fundamental to American democracy.


Writing for Raw Story, Paul Hildera former online strategist for Change.org, Avaaz and 38 Degreesargues that using technology and distributed organizing, the Bernie Sanders campaign is changing the laws of political physics and building the most extraordinary grassroots momentum I have ever seen. On that basis he argues that Sanders could still overtake Hillary Clinton in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.


So, it turns out that Marco Rubios campaign strategy is indeed programmed by robots, as Sasha Issenberg reports for Bloomberg Politics. He details how the campaignaware that it would be out-fundraised by rivals but thinking it had the most naturally charismatic contenderhas been relying on a data-driven operation focused on getting Rubio into free media opportunities that are most likely to get him in front of the right voters in the districts where he has had the best chance of getting delegatesand how that strategy has been upended by Trumps greater skill at getting free coverage. And he explains why Rubio is now trying to out-Trump Trump by getting into the gutter with him by mocking his small hands, among other gibesits getting him lots of free TV.

Right now the FBI is falling far short, trivializing the risk to the rest of us when backdoors are created and used at scale. They have made an internal calculation that the trade-offs are well worth the risks, without really having a conversation with the public in which they even measure the risks.

Crypto-wars, continued: A federal judge in New York has given Apple a major legal victory, ruling against the governments request in a drug case that it be forced to help extract data from a locked iPhone, Glenn Greenwald and Jenna McLaughlin report for The Intercept. The ruling suggests the government is over-reaching in its demand that Apple unlock the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters.


The ACLUs chief technologist, Chris Soghoian, explains in the Washington Post why the FBIs insistence on forcing Apple to write software to crack open a terrorists iPhone imperils the cybersecurity regime that now protects most of our software.


Birth of a movement: Academics Deen Freelon, Charlton Mcilwaine and Meredith Clark have published an incredibly detailed in-depth study of the Black Lives Matter online movement, derived from examining more than 40 million tweets using hashtags related to the movement, 100,000 related web links and interviews with top BLM activists and allies. One fascinating finding: while the term Black Lives Matter was first used in July 2013 after the George Zimmerman verdict in the Trayvon Martin killing, and it was used again in the wake of the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown the following summer, it first penetrated beyond activist circles around the announcement that the St. Louis grand jury would not indict police officer Darren Wilson. That day, use of the hashtag soared to more than 103,000. The report breaks the rise of #BlackLivesMatter into several distinct episodic sections, each one with its own social network diagram describing the involvement and connections between grouping like black celebrities, mainstream news, the mostly white left, the multiracial left, Anonymous, and conservatives opposed to the movement.

What sharing economy? Remember Tom Slee and Murray Coxs investigative report that raised questions about Airbnbs host listing data in New York City? The company has now admitted, in a letter to New York lawmakers, many of whom have been critical of the companys practices, that it removed selected listings from its sites before a carefully controlled data release back in December, as Kristen Brown reports for Fusion. Thus it has essentially confirming Slee and Coxs core allegation, that it had cooked its books to reduce the number of multiple listings on the site. Airbnb now says it will keep removing hosts with multiple unit listings from its NYC site. More than one-third of host revenue still comes from such sharelords.


Theres a lesson here for journalists covering the sharing economy: sometimes the story is hidden in plain view, but you have to track company usage data over time or youll never see it. Slee and Cox had been scraping Airbnb public data for months, which is how they were able to spot the companys own scrubbing of its listings in advance of its transparency push.

This is civic tech: And, in my humble opinion, a big deal too. ActBlue, the fundraising platform for Democratic and progressive political candidates that has processed nearly $1 billion in donations since its founding 11 years ago, is launching ActBlue Charities. As ActBlue Executive Director Erin Hill explains, charities of all sizes will be able to use the platform, getting immediate access to ActBlue 2.4 million-strong Express user base and benefiting from the companys hard-won experience optimizing its contributions interface. Notably, the nonprofit is staying progressive, as Hill writes, ActBlue Charities is open to any c3 organization that is willing to engage in grassroots fundraising, and whose activity doesnt contradict ActBlue Charities policies and values. Those values include (but arent limited to) social equality, womens rights, LGBTQ rights, racial justice, diversity, freedom of speech, and respect for scientific inquiry, discovery, and data.

I shouldnt have to see the pain, struggle, and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work every day.

Tech and politics: Darren Samuelsohn offers Politico readers a guided tour of the sprawling network of volunteer coders who are fueling the Bern. Its a great piece, full of dueling quotes from different camps in the tech-politics arena. On one side are the new generation of DIYers like start-up entrepreneur Daniela Perdomo, the spearhead of feelthebern.org, who touts the efficiency and passion of organic grassroots contributions. On the other side are people like Hillary Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson, who takes a dig at all the headlines the Berniacs are getting, insisting that his teams focus on optimization will win the day.


The only note Samuelsohn gets wrong is in writing that The dispersed nature of Sanders operation may be familiar in the tech world, but its a novelty in politics... Actually, if you were there for the 2003-04 Howard Dean campaign, none of this is new; the Dean campaign was renowned for its decentralized support baseincluding an army of volunteer coders.


What is different about the Sanders coder base is that it is spinning its wheels in an age of ubiquitous social networking platforms. Those Hack4Dean coders were virtually connected back in 2003; now everyone (just about) is connected. Facebook was actually founded a few days before Dean ended his campaign, in fact. Now, according to a recent Pew Internet survey, 37 percent of American adults say that sometime in the past week they got information about the presidential election from Facebook. Local TV news is the top source (57 percent), cable TV news is second (54 percent), then national nightly network TV news (49 percent), followed by radio (44 percent). In terms of the news sites considered most helpful to learning something about the election, cable TV news ranked highest at 24 percent, followed by local TV news (14 percent), radio (11 percent), national nightly network television news (10 percent) and then Facebook (9 percent).

Crypto wars, continued: The FBI has asked Apple to build a new version of its iOS software so it can be installed on an iPhone recovered during its investigation of the San Bernadino terror attack, and company president Tim Cook has posted this letter to his customers, explaining why Apple is refusing to do so. He writes, in part:
The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customersincluding tens of millions of American citizensfrom sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe. We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.
 


Editorial comment: Leaving aside the arguments over strong encryption (which we generally support) and backdoors (which we oppose), its worth noting two things about Cooks action. First, unlike other tech companies battling the government, Apple so far hasnt used its platform power to astro-turf its lobbying. And second, in this case, its taking a principled position that may hurt its bottom line if political pressure grows. Not bad. (Now, about all those U.S. taxes youve avoided paying, Tim...)

Clintons digital strategist, Teddy Goff, told Hamburger, The Sanders team is doing a terrific job, and they are ahead of us in small donors. Our argument is that we are both doing a pretty good job. This is not a zero-sum game. The democracy is stronger when large numbers of people give small donations. We have 750,000 donors; Bernie has even more. Thats a great sign for the party.

Tech and politics: Writing for The New Yorker, historian Jill Lepore connects the collapse of the Republican and Democratic party establishments to the rise of the internet. As she notes, this may be the first Presidential-primary season with free Wi-Fi pretty much everywhere. But more seriously, she offers a warning:
Accelerated political communication can have all manner of good effects for democracy, spreading news about rallies, for instance, or getting hundreds of thousands of signatures on a petition lickety-split. Less often noticed are the ill effects, which include the atomizing of the electorate. Theres a point at which political communication speeds past the last stop where democratic deliberation, the genuine consent of the governed, is possible. An instant poll, of the sort that pops up on your screen while youre attempting to read debate coverage, encourages snap and solitary judgment, the very opposite of whats necessary for the exercise of good citizenship. Democracy takes time. It requires civic bonds, public institutions, and a free press. And in the United States, so far, it has needed parties.

Small donors, big data: In 2004, Howard Deans presidential campaign built a grassroots base of 600,000 donors, largely by using the internet, and vaulted a formerly obscure small-state Governor to the top of the Democratic field, for a time. We all felt the muscle flex of this new progressive movement and were stunned by it, Nicco Mele, Deans webmaster, told me back then. Well, now a formerly obscure small-state U.S. Senator has been vaulted to the top of this years Democratic field, and overnight between Tuesdays New Hampshire primary and yesterday afternoon, we saw that muscle, rebuilt, flex again. In the 18 hours after the polls closed, the Sanders campaign reported raising $5.2 million, at an average of $34 per donation. In 23 hours, it hit $6.3 million, according to this Kenneth Vogel story in Politico (which does a nice job of profiling Tim Tagaris, one of Sanders key online strategists). By the evening yesterday, according to an ActBlue thermometer included in a follow-up email from the campaign, the Sanders haul had reached $7 million, a new record for one day during a president primary.


The one-day record for a fundraising email by a presidential campaign during a primary was previously held by the 2008 Ron Paul campaign, which invented the money bomb and raised $6 million from 58,000 donors on December 18, 2007 (the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party). The 2012 Obama campaign raised $10 million overnight after Sarah Palins acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, where she mocked him for being a community organizer.


New Hampshire has long been a great springboard for fundraising online; in 2000 John McCains upset victory over George W. Bush generated $1 million in such donations through his website, averaging $110 each. (Kids, candidates with websites and people making donations using credit cards was a novelty back then. It was a big deal in the fall of 1999 when Bill Bradley, the Sanders to Al Gores Clinton, announced he had raised $650,000 that way.)

What sharing economy? Remember Airbnbs transparency press event at Civic Hall in December, when it invited members of the press to come view a spreadsheet of its New York City user data? A new report by Murray Cox of Insideairbnb.com and Tom Slee, author of Whats Yours in Mine: Against the Sharing Economy, shows the data was photoshopped: Airbnb ensured it would paint a flattering picture by carrying out a one-time targeted purge of over 1,000 listings in the first three weeks of November. Specifically, the company removed more than 1,000 entire home listings from its site, using the resulting data to argue that only 10% of those listings belonged to hosts with multiple listings. The true number had been close to 19% for all of 2015, Cox and Slee point out. The number of multiple listings is an indication of sharelords, people who arent just renting out a room or their own apartment on occasion, but using the platform to turn their properties into de-facto hotels and circumvent state laws.


Commenting on Cox and Slees report, New York state senator Liz Krueger, a longtime Airbnb critic, said, Far from being open and transparent, this report shows that Airbnb intentionally misled the press and elected officials in New York. The data clearly disproves Airbnbs perennial argument that they want to work with city officials to protect everyday New Yorkers, fight illegal hotel activity, and remove bad actors from their site. Instead, it appears the company took extraordinary onetime measures to manipulate data and make themselves look good on one day in one city.


Cox and Slees report has generated critical coverage in The Guardian, Re/Code, The Awl, and Fusion. Christopher Nulty, Airbnbs public affairs head for eastern North America, has responded to the report, arguing that most Airbnb users are single-listers, not sharelords. He says, Our community in New York has evolved to a point where 94 percent of hosts have just one listing and where there is no material presence of illegal hotels, which is why accusations from the same elected officials who called for there to be no illegal hotels on the platform and now want to fine middle class families $50,000 is akin to asking someone to walk on water and then, when they do, fining them for not swimming.


This is civic tech: Public Labs Jeff Warren announces the launch of Spectral Workbench 2, an updated version of the nonprofits kitchen table tool for analyzing chemical traces. Heres a great profile of Public Labs work by Benjamin Preston for Make magazine.(Full disclosure: I serve on Public Labs board.)


President Obama went to Springfield, Illinois, on the 9th anniversary of his launching his first campaign for the presidency to talk about fixing the nations politics, and issued a call for universal automatic voter registration and an end to partisan gerrymandering of election districts.


Crypto-wars, continued: Rep. Ted Lieu (R-CA) has introduced the Ensuring National Constitutional Rights for Your Private Telecommunications Act of 2016, or ENCRYPT. As Brian Barrett writes for Wired, its a short, straightforward bill with a simple aim: to preempt states from attempting to implement their own anti-encryption policies at a state level.


If the core conflict of the 21st century is between open and closed, as our friend Alec Ross likes to say, then Simon Oxenhams story on the rise of Sci-hub.com, a sort of Pirate Bay for academic science papers, is proof that open is winning.

Tech and the presidentials: After swiftly conceding to Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire last night, Hillary Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook sent a memo to reporters promising a data-driven approach to maximizing delegates going forward and urging them not to make too much of the next two primaries compared to the delegate-rich votes in March. It reads, in part:
The way to win the nomination is to maximize the number of delegates we secure from each primary and caucus. That means, in many cases, that the margin of victory (or defeat) within a given state is actually more important than whether the state is won or lost. Thus, the campaign is building the type of modern, data-driven operation that it will take to turn voters out and win the most possible delegates.
The memo goes on to promise that each congressional district will have its own data-driven plan.The memo uses the word data-driven four times overall.


Upon winning the primary, Bernie Sanders made a live call for donations during his televised victory speech, which ActBlues Erin Hill tells First Post led to incoming traffic at historic levels. Some donors did experience a still processing message that appeared to hang, but Hill says, In big moments, we prioritize incoming contributions first, sending receipts and updating metrics later. Thats by design and that worked by design last night. ...Everything processed. There was a snafu with our thanks page UI, however, that caused donors to not get to the thanks page & leave some uncertainty about whether those contributions were completed. That was not by design and something we got fixed within an hour. But obviously not the experience we want donors to ever have, which is why we were also busy with concurrent real time customer service last night. (Shes too modest to say that she was still up at 4 am doing some of that customer service.)


Hillary Clinton knows what selfies are, but according to this report from Amy Chozick of the New York Times, shes not sure what it means for something to go viral.


As a fan of puns and culture hacks, heres a robo-call out to Aaron Black of Americans United for Change, who jumped on Marco Rubios robotic performance during last weeks GOP debate and started following the candidate around dressed in a silver robot costume and holding a #RobotRubio sign. After some Rubio supporters roughed him up, an incident that was captured on video, Black spoke to Politicos Nick Gass, saying, You know, I dont know what their major malfunction was, but I must have seriously pressed their buttons.


Trump watch: Voxs Ezra Klein has a must-read reminder on why Trumps continuing rise is terrifying.


This is civic tech: West Carrolton, Ohio, is the first city to power its website with ProudCitys beta product, reports Dustin Hailer for GovTech.com.


The Sunlight Foundations Politwoops site is back online, after being shut down by Twitter. The revived tool will now include every deleted tweet made by elected officials and candidates for office, and there are plans to expand to executive branch officials and state legislators. Already it has caught deleted tweets from Donald Trump, John Kasich, and Chris Christie.


Congrats to Civic Hall member David Moore, who demoed NYC Councilmatic at the NY Tech Meetup last night, his first time on that stage.


Life in Facebookistan: Longtime tech industry observer Om Malik explains why he has always been critical of Facebooks so-called Internet.org or Free Basics project. I am suspicious of any for-profit company arguing its good intentions and its free gifts.


Outspoken VC Marc Andreessen takes the opposite and ahistorical view, tweeting, Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now? As Kurt Wagner reports for Re/Code, the backlash was swift and fierce and ultimately the chastened Andreessen tweeted a full apology.

This is civic tech: The great John Perry Barlow looks back on the 20th anniversary of his Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. And while he expresses a few regrets (was it the champagne, he asks?) about his somewhat naive belief that the net would govern itself with consensus systems aimed at the commonweal, he asserts, I do not believe that the Nation State, for all its efforts to bring the Net to heel, has really succeeded. It is still the case that if one is reasonably savvy technically, he or she can express whatever they wish without fear of reprisal....The War between the Control Freaks and the Forces of Open-ness, whether of code, government, or expression, remains the same dead heat its been stuck on all these years.


Speaking of the forces of openness: New York City Council member Ben Kallos is pushing two bills, the Free and Open Source Software Act, which would minimize city contracts using proprietary software, and the Civic Commons Act, which would encourage the collaborative use of free and open source software among agencies, cities and states. The councils committee on contracting will hear testimony on both bills February 23.


Our Christine Cupaiuolo takes a close look at two technologies that British researchers have been using in conjunction with major political debates there. The first, Democratic Replay, is an open-source web platform that enables viewers to re-watch a debate with a full array of interactive visuals and analytics on discourse, audience feedback, debate topics (such as healthcare or the economy), and, in the future, data-mining tools that could answer such questions as, Did the candidate actually promise this last year? The second, Democratic Reflection, is an audience-response web app that enables viewers to choose in real-time from a panoply of nuanced responses, that range from straightforward (This is informative / Im losing interest) to more complex reflections (If s/he understood my situation, s/he wouldnt say this / S/hes provided convincing evidence for this claim). As she reports, the University of Leeds team that built the tool is open to discussions with media partners in and outside Britain interested in using the Democratic Reflection app in future debates.


Tech and the presidentials: It looks like some voters in New Hampshire have been receiving so-called voter-shaming mailers aimed at trying to push them to vote by supposedly comparing their voting history to their neighbors, but as Rachel Stockman reports for LawNewz.com, its not clear what campaign is sending them out.


Has presidential long-shot John Kasich been reading Sherry Turkle on the dangers of the digital age? Here he is talking at campaign event yesterday in New Hampshire, as reported by Ross Choma and David Corn for Mother Jones:
Our lives are being lived so fast. Were constantly on the device. The Apple TV...Have to get the new Apple phone. He held up an iPhone, as he continued: We have to slow our lives down and listen to peoples hurts and victories. He repeated this call to de-accelerate: When we do...its a more beautiful world.
 


Video satirist Hugh Atkin catches Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio debating with himself on whether or not President Obama knows what hes doing. The results arent pretty.


The almost-too-close-to-call Iowa Democratic caucus battle gets a detailed deconstruction from Darren Samuelsohn of Politico, who shows that party leaders in the state were not prepared for the way the Clinton-Sanders race tightened and precinct volunteers were often not interested in using Microsofts app for reporting caucus results.


Digital advertising firm Dstillery used location data to identify more than 16,000 mobile phones that appeared at caucus locations across Iowa, Donovan Slack reports for USA Today. The company found that sports fans and techies were more likely to show up at caucuses won by Marco Rubio or Bernie Sanders, where those who were into grilling, lawn and garden care, and other household DIYers were more likely at caucuses won decisively by Donald Trump.


International internet: Facebooks Free Basics program had only reached one million of Indias 252 million internet users, Reuterss Jeremy Wagstaff and Himank Sharma report. The decision by Indian regulators to effectively kill the program for violating net neutrality will likely embolden other regulators to demand equal access from ISPs elsewhere, they note.


Commenting on Mark Zuckerbergs Facebook page, Anil Dash tries to school the company CEO in the problematic history of Western colonialism in India, writing, A colonialist trust us, its for your own benefit pitch is a hard sell with good reason....What about pausing the Internet Basics effort and spending some time on a real effort to listen to Indian voices about what would help them have connectivity on their own terms, in a way they find acceptable? Zuckerberg kind of maybe gets it, replying I think youre right about focusing on following the local culture and empowering local entrepreneurs. The giant social networking company is also facing a setback in France, where regulators are giving Facebook three months to stop tracking non-users activity and to also end the transfer of personal data to the United States, Reuters reports.

This is civic tech: Writing for TechCrunch, Stacy Donohue, investment partner at the Omidyar Network, offers three predictions about the rising fortunes of civic tech in 2016. First, a new wave of citizen engagement tools and platforms aimed at education voters and boosting voter turnout, like Change Politics. Second, more funding opportunities than ever, citing an internal study showing that 23 civic tech companies raised $285 million in 2015. And, third, more governments will embrace civic tech startups, citing the success of CityMart as one example.


Registration has opened for the School of Data, BetaNYCs civic tech and open data conference on March 5 here at Civic Hall.


International internet: In a huge victory for net neutrality activists in India, the countrys top regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, announced new rules today banning internet service providers from having differential policies for accessing different parts of the web, Reuters reports. The decision is a huge blow to Facebooks Free Basics program there. Heres the authoritys full statement.


On Friday, Twitter announced that it had suspended more than 125,000 accounts for threatening or promoting terrorists acts, primarily related to ISIS.


That news was quickly overshadowed by Alex Kantrowitzs story for BuzzFeed that Twitter was about to introduce an algorithmic timeline set off a firestorm of protest among loyal users of the app, leading Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to re-assure users that real-time feeds werent going away and that we never planned to reorder timelines next week.


Tech and the presidentials: According to former President Bill Clinton, after staffers from Bernie Sanders campaign took advantage of a database failure to access confidential Clinton campaign voter data last fall, in private they sent an email out saying that the Democratic party had left the keys in the car, and all I did was drive off, reports Jonathan Martin for the New York Times. Clintons harsh comments on Sanders, coming two days before the New Hampshire primary, mark a sharp shift in the ex-Presidents public role in the presidential campaign.


Note to candidates: Google Translate doesnt travel well. After observing how people are live-sharing presidential events in New Hampshire, An Xiao Mina of Meedan takes a close look at how social media works, or doesnt work, in translation. Attacks on the establecimiento sound like you are attacking a physical building, rather than el systema, for example.

This is civic tech: In Civicist, Kristen Rouse, the founder of the NYC Veterans Alliance, describes how relationships she built after joining Civic Hall helped her win a big legislative victory here this past year.


Also in Civicist, SeeClickFix co-founder Ben Berkowitz offers some hard-won advice for other civic tech entrepreneurs on how to build a successful platform for engaging residents and city officials.


Former Los Angeles chief data officer and Code for America OG Abhi Nemani offers a useful list of 7 tactics for fostering 21st century civic life including creating collaborative hubs, pulling in civic-minded capital, opening up slots for civic innovators to work inside government, focusing attention through contests and dedicated media, educational programs, creating more civic apps, open data, and strengthening user engagement.


Making the rounds: the video presentation of Equipay, the Comedy Hack Day San Francisco 2016 Grand Prize winner. Dont be fooled by its formal description: Pulling data income data from U.S. Department of Labor, Equipay allows you and your friends to split the cost of a meal in accordance with gender and racial income inequalities.


Tech and politics: Some young women are using Tinder to campaign for Bernie Sanders, Joseph Bernstein reports for BuzzFeed.


Molly Longman of Cosmopolitan magazine went on Tinder while attending a bunch of rallies for most of the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, to see what kind of guys were nearby on the app. The results are pretty hilarious.


Classified information was sent to the private email account of Secretary of State Colin Powell and top aides of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, NBC News Ken Dilanian reports, suggesting that Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while Secretary wasnt unusual.


The FCC is close to finished updating rules for the Lifeline service to allow it to begin subsidizing Internet service to low-income Americans, Maria Trujillo reports for The Hill.


Crypto-wars, continued: Oscar-winning documentarian Laura Poitras is publishing a book February 23rd called Astro Noise: A Survival Guide for Living Under Total Surveillance, and as Andy Greenberg previews for Wired, its based on journals she kept detailing what its been like for her to be on the U.S. governments watch list for years.

This is civic tech: Conteneos CEO Luke Hohmann previews this months participatory budgeting project for the city of San Jose, where the company has worked with local officials since 2013. The target is 1,000 people in in-person sessions and 50,000 people participating online with our Decision Engine to prioritize how San Jose should invest the portion of its budget devoted to programs and services that affect San Joses neighborhoods, he tells Kathleen Goolsby of Sandhill.com. This is a zero-based budgeting opportunity in which the budget allocation from the prior fiscal year will stay the same, but the set of programs and services will change based on resident feedback.


As part of the Obama Administrations Connect Home broadband initiative, which says that every child should have access to high-speed affordable Internet, Google Fiber has announced that it is giving a few hundred residents of public housing projects in Kansas City free gigabit internet service, promising to do so for residents in all public housing properties that we connect to in that city and boasting that it will eventually reach more than 1,300 families in nine properties. The company says it will bring similar free service to select affordable housing in other Fiber cities. Yahoo! At this rate, free gigabit service from Google will reach the 45 million Americans who cant afford high-speed broadband sometime in 11016 A.D. (Alphabet, Googles parent company, is one of the worlds top two most valuable companies at the moment, worth around $550 billion.)


The Marshall Projects Maurice Chammah reports on how cops in East St. Louis are using HunchLab, a predictive policing tool made by Philadelphias Azavea (a B Corporation), to help them decide which so-called hot-spots in the citys neighborhoods are in need of more attention. As Chammah notes, unlike other companies in the predictive policing marketplace, Azaveas rhetoric is civic-minded; the companys other projects include tools to analyze legislative districts, as well as an app that helps city residents map the locations of trees in order to study their environmental impact. Chammahs article is worth a close readunlike many pieces on predictive policing, it doesnt overstate the value of the technology and it is careful to give voice to critics like the Massachusetts ACLUs Kade Crawford, director of its Technology for Liberty program, who see the whole field as only adding a veneer of technological authority to practices that still disproportionately target young black men.


Tech and politics: DeRay Mckesson, a leading independent activist in the Movement for Black Lives who rose to prominence by his adroit use of Twitter, has announced that he is running for mayor of Baltimore, joining an already crowded field, as John Eligon reports for the New York Times. The Democratic primary there is April 26.


Google is starting a pilot program with NGOs using the companys Adwords grant program to enable them to run ads against terrorism-related search queries of their choosing, in an attempt to boost counter-radicalization efforts by those groups, Ben Quinn reports for The Guardian. (Early reports on this project incorrectly stated that Google would be redirecting search results to anti-radicalization sites.)


Building on a network analysis of 120,000 individuals from the LittleSis database of politically connected Americans and the timing of their campaign contributions to Barack Obama or John McCain in the 2012 election, a Dutch political scientist named Vincent Traag has found that the likelihood of someone donating increases not only when someone in their personal network gives to a candidate (hello, bundlers!), but also when they see people from other networks that they are weakly linked also giving. Our findings suggest that appealing to constituencies of diverse backgrounds may actually aid in diffusing support through networks, Traag tells MITs Technology Review.


Crypto-wars, continued: A United Nations panel , the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, has ruled that Julian Assanges confinement in the Ecuadorian embassy in London amounts to his being arbitrarily confined, the BBCs Caroline Hawley reports. The WikiLeaks founder has said that if the panels ruling went the other way, he would leave the embassy and accept arrest. The panels ruling is not legally binding, but as Hawley notes, Previous rulings by the panel have gone against countries with some of the worlds worst human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and Egypt.


A group of political activists and leaders of internet rights groups including La Quadrature du Net and Access Now are criticizing Twitter for alerting them when their accounts are attacked by state-sponsored actors but then releasing no information indicating which country is probing their personal information, Bethany Horne reports for The Guardian.

The Uber Bowl: Thousands of Uber drivers are planning to assemble Sunday in San Francisco to disrupt traffic around the Super Bowl, Mike Dean reports for the Observer. 1,000 drove in protest through the city on Monday to protest the companys fare cuts.


Related: Noam Scheiber reports for the New York Times on rising labor conflicts not just aimed at Uber, but also Lyft and Postmates, highlighting the Good Work Code being championed by the National Domestic Workers Alliance as a response. Uber drivers in Dallas and Seattle have succeeded in collectively pressing the company for some policy reversals, Scheiber reports. In Tampa several hundred protesting drivers have started an weekly logout of an hour or two during peak periods for weekend revelers, he reports, using Zello, an app-based walkie-talkie service, to communicate with each other.


Note to self: In the digital age, a walkout by on-demand workers is to be called a logout. (And I remember when we thought logging in was the radical move.)

Donald Trumps failure to listen to advisors telling him to invest more in tech and data for voter targeting allowed him to get out-organized in Iowa, Kenneth Vogel and Darren Samuelsohn report for Politico.

They add, It is, in effect, a carefully-crafted loophole wide enough to drive all of existing mass surveillance practice through.


European and American negotiators have reached a deal renewing safe harbor regulations allowing American tech companies to keep moving peoples digital data across the Atlantic, Mark Scott reports for the New York Times. The deal still has to be approved by the EUs member states. And as Techdirts Mike Masnick cogently notes, the core issue that is still unresolved is whether the US government will stop indiscriminate mass surveillance of personal data of foreigners that moves through US-based servers.

Tech and the presidentials: Sasha Issenberg, pretty much owning the data-driven campaign beat again in 2016, reports for Bloomberg Politics on Ted Cruzs voter targeting operation in Iowa, known inside the campaign as the Oorlog Project (taken from the Afrikaner word for warand as far as we know not an endorsement of apartheid, just some staffers delight in the words sound). Some nuggets: Cruz came against Iowas fireworks law because his analysts had identified 60 votes who could potentially swayed by it, something they discovered by experimenting putting micro-message ads in the Facebook feeds of self-identified Iowa Republicans. Ah, democracy at work.


Perhaps a day late on its relevance, heres Ben Smith, editor in chief of Buzzfeed, reporting on how dethroned GOP frontrunner Donald Trump dominates the media, new and old.

Crypto and privacy: A new study from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard argues that the fears of government agencies that strong encryption will let evildoers go dark are outdated by the emerging Internet of Things, where user privacy is essentially non-existent. As Xeni Jardin cogently points out on BoingBoing, Basically, theyre saying the government wont have any problem tracking us and surveilling our communications, because were freely sharing a lot of very revealing personal data and metadata to third parties, all day, every day, security be damned.

What sharing economy? Hundreds of Uber drivers in New York City went on strike yesterday to protest cuts in fares made by the company, the New York Times Marc Santora and John Surico report. One driver, Tsering Sherpa, said the lower rates would force him to work 10 to 14 hour days, declaring, They call us partners. But theyre treating us like slaves. Uber says it has lowered prices to get more people using Uber, which is good for drivers because it means less time waiting around for trips.


Dont miss Steven Johnsons eloquent rebuttal of Paul Grahams defense of inequality as the engine of Silicon Valleys tech innovation. Most intriguing is Johnsons argument that the tech sector is actually more egalitarian than most American businesses for how well it rewards employees at all levels, and suggests that a maximum income ratio of 40-to-1 would fit quite easily within the parameters of what most Valley companies now provide their workforces. Johnson writes:
Right now the tech market, even with its admirable pay ratios, is signaling to the world that inventing a new app for teenagers to flirt and banter can be thousands of times more valuable than becoming a high-school principal in a troubled district. That is a ratio with real costs to society. And I say that as a believer in these technologies!

Iowa watch: Joe Rospars, the founder and CEO of Blue State Digital, draws on his seminal experience in digital campaigning for Howard Dean and Barack Obama to produce a very smart analysis in the Washington Post of the dynamics of the Clinton-Sanders presidential battle. Rospars points out that both candidates teams inherited an ingrained culture of constant testing and data-driven optimization that shapes every ad, every email, every call script for a volunteer and every list of voters they call. And both campaigns have built their organizing efforts on the foundation of tech and data infrastructure at the Democratic National Committee that first came together in the 2008 cycle.


Rospars, who is neutral in the 2016 primary, also notes that whether you support him or not, Sanderss campaign is the home of the prevailing grass-roots energy in this race. The most recent financial reports, for the period that ended in October, showed that the amount Clinton raised from donors giving less than $200 decreased from $8 million to $5.2 million, while Sanderss low-dollar take nearly doubled, from $10.4 million to $20.2 million. Clinton raised barely a quarter of the amount from grass-roots donors that Sanders did. Whatever the ultimate result, that shows the Sanders campaign has accomplished extraordinary things in volunteer mobilization and small-donor fundraising, period. The Sanders campaign announced that it will bring in $20 million in January, Matea Gold reports for the Washington Post, calling it an astonishing sum that underscores the power of its online fundraising operation.


While you wait for the Iowa caucus results, you can take a trip down memory lane with Esquires Jack Holmes, who has gathered an oral history of YEAHHHHHHH! from a gaggle of former Howard Dean campaign staffers. Relive how internet-powered Howard melted down, with the infamous scream just the crowning blow.


Caucus math: Sasha Issenberg reports for Bloomberg Politics on how the Hillary Clinton campaign has worked hard to avoid the mistakes it made in the lead-up to Iowa in 2008, when Barack Obamas superior field operation took her by surprise. From what Issenberg details, the Clinton team has a customized campaign plan for each of the states 1,681 precincts.


Republican Ted Cruzs campaign is reportedly doing a lot of behavioral targeting, but a mailer sent to some Iowans warning them that they had a failing voting score was denounced by Iowas secretary of state, who says There is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting, reports Mother Jones Pema Levy. Hilariously, one of the people who received a Cruz mailer was Iowa State University professor David Peterson, who runs the journal Political Behavior, and who told Levy that his own alleged voting score was inaccurate. (Every one of his neighbors who received the same mailer got the same score.)

Soltani had previously worked for the Federal Trade Commission, but he had also done work for the Washington Post, helping it analyze and protect its cache of NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden.


President Obama wants to dedicate $4 billion in new Department of Education funding over the next three years to reward states for increasing computer science education in schools, Davey Alba reports for Wired.

This is civic tech: Building on David Moores essay yesterday about the need for open data standards for civic information, Mark Headd of Accela chimes in, asking What organization(s) have the clout, impartiality and durability to bring together disparate interests and help craft a new data standard?


Speaking of open data, the FCC just voted to require all but the smallest cable, satellite, and radio stations to upload their political files, which reveal who is buying what ads and when they run, online. As Libby Watson points out on the Sunlight Foundation blog, these files are technically open public records but only available for viewing on paper at each stations office. This FCC decision will make Sunlights Political Ad Sleuth tool far more useful.


Presidential Innovation Fellows Kate McCall-Kiley, Luke Keller, and Adam Bonnifield go behind-the-scenes on the development of Vote.USA.gov, a new platform they built in just two weeks that helps citizens find out how to register to vote in their state. They also report that Facebook has partnered with the site, using its tools to alert users to state registration deadlines, writing With the help of this Facebook pilot, more people registered to vote in one day than did so in the entire previous two weeks.


Tech and the presidentials: Snapchat has started a political campaign show anchored by former CNN reporter Peter Hamby, Steven Perlberg reports for the Wall Street Journal.


Presidential campaigns are uploading their email lists and voter files to Facebooks advertising network, which then matches real-life voters with their Facebook accounts, Harry Davies and Danny Yadron report for the Guardian. This is allowing campaigns like Ted Cruzs to target voters on a range of broad issues like immigration controls to niche specific causes such as abolishing state laws against the sale of fireworks. The company is also finding users who like lots of political content and share it with their friends, mark[ing] them as political influencers and allow[ing] campaigns to target them specifically.


As the Guardian reports, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks COO, told investors on an earnings call Wednesday that the 2016 election is a big deal in terms of ad spend, adding Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those. And were seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting. Luckily, Facebook is helping more voters register too (see above item).


Whither privacy? With signs that the Federal Trade Commission is going to start policing privacy violations more stringently, business lobbyists are mounting an active campaign to delegitimize its efforts, Chris Jay Hoofnagle, UC Berkeley privacy expert, writes for The Hill.

This is civic tech: David Moore of the Participatory Politics Foundation (longtime friend of Personal Democracy Media and Civic Hall member) lays out a detailed vision of the open data infrastructure for civic engagement that the U.S. civic tech field badly needs. Believe it or not, we still dont have open data for every elected official and candidate; nor do we have open standards for constituent communication data.


YCombinators Sam Altman announces a research project aimed at exploring the idea of a universal basic income. They want to give a basic income to a group of people in the U.S. for a five year period, and theyre looking for a full-time researcher to lead the project. (Who will presumably get something more than a basic income. Oh, the irony.)


Mark your calendars: Personal Democracy Forum Poland-CEE 2016, our fourth annual European sister conference, will be taking place in the historic city of Gdansk this coming March 17-18. The theme this year is Re/Disconnecting Citizens. For more details and to register, go here.

The Grassroots for Sanders sub-reddit, which has more than 150,000 subscribers, has raised more than $1 million through its own dedicated portal for the campaign, the Burlington Free Press Jess Aloe reports.


More than half the people Donald Trump has retweeted so far this week have white supremacist connections, Jay Hathaway reports for New York magazine, citing data from Marshal Kirkpatricks data analysis service LittleBird. (Do note: the connections cited are things like following one of the top 50 White Nationalist accounts on Twitter or following at least three people who have used the hashtag #WhiteGenocide recently.)


Something to like: Remember Facebooks experiment in giving its staff a taste of the slow internet service its poorer users experience in the developing world, which was supposed to help them be more empathetic. Well, the guy who signed off on that idea, Chris Cox, Facebooks chief product officer, is now leading the companys push to drop its Like button for a new, more varied feedback tool called Reactions, reports Sarah Frier for Bloomberg Business.


Friers story is filled with fascinating findings about life inside the heart of Facebookistan, including this gem about the impact of people liking stuff on the site: In January, [company chief operating officer Sheryl] Sandberg went so far as to suggest that likes could help defeat Islamic State: By posting positive messages on the terror groups Facebook pages, users could somehow drown out the hate.

Tech and the presidentials: We couldnt help but notice this tantalizing line at the bottom of Sundays New York Times story about President Obamas love of tech gadgets: In long dinners with Silicon Valley titans, [President Obama] has talked extensively about ways to better use personal technology to increase voter turnout and improve civic engagement. So we went looking and managed to dig up a partial transcript of one of those dinners, featuring Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn, Eric Schmidt of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Mark Pincus of Zynga and Travis Kalanick of Uber.


Speaking of Uber, dont miss Dana Rubinsteins report for Capital New York on how the companys lobbyists worked last summer with Governor Andrew Cuomo to undermine New York City Mayor Bill de Blasios opposition to its expansion. They even had a draft executive order ready for his signature that would have overruled any city regulation blocking the companys growth, Rubinstein reports.


According to a Bernie Sanders supporter on Reddit, the number of people showing up to phonebank for the Vermont Senator vastly outweighs the numbers showing up for Hillary Clinton, based on reports from both campaigns websites. For example, in the Los Angeles zip code of 90021, just 5 people are listed as phone banking for Clinton, compared to 318 for Sanders. In Austin, its 443 to 1.


According to Echelon Insights, Sanders and Clinton are closely matched in Iowa and New Hampshire Facebook conversations. Not surprisingly, Donald Trump has the lions share of conversation in both states. Intriguingly, a Trump campaign YouTube video on how to caucus in Iowa and a caucus finder on his website are among the links most shared in that state.


Want to know the type of people Donald Trump retweets? Then just following @TrumpRetweeps, a twitter bot built by the geniuses at Fusion, which tweets the Twitter bio of everyone Trump plugs, as Daniel McLaughlin explains.

Remember our 10Questions.com project, which crowdsourced questions to the presidential candidates back in 2007? The Des Moines Register and Change Politics, Change.orgs new elections platform, collected questions for the Democratic presidential candidates for an online townhall forum in Iowa and got their answers to the most popular top five.


Related: As T.C. Sottek writes for The Verge, the cable networks that host these debates are just become showrooms for internet companies to display their products from.

This is civic tech: Building on earlier writing (including work he did for techPresident and republished in our book A Lever and a Place to Stand), Matt Leighninger of the Deliberative Democracy Consortium suggests some key goals for the civic tech field. He writes:
To make our democracies more participatory, energetic, efficient and equitable, we should take stock of how civic tech can be part of an overhaul of our whole civic infrastructure. How can online tools help revitalize face-to-face meetings? How can online forums help sustain social and political connections among large numbers of people? How can we give more people  especially those who face barriers related to education, language and economic stability  the skills and support they need to participate effectively, online or off?
 


Craig Newmark (founder of Craigslist and longtime friend of Personal Democracy Media and Civic Hall) is teaming up with Crowdrise to launch a massive Water for Flint challenge. For every $20 donated to any CrowdRise campaign for Flint Water Crisis Relief, his charity craigconnects with match it with 100 cases of water to be distributed to Flint residents. Newmark says, The deal is I want to put clean drinking water into the hands of every person whos in Flint, Michigan. I actually spent about a decade living not too far from Flint, so this really hits close to home for me. So far, hes donated 17,335 cases of water.


Nithin Coca has a fascinating in-depth look for Greenpeaces MobLab at Taiwans Sunflower movement, which is using software, social media, and other rapidly evolving technologies [to fuel] digital democracy and political change in Taiwan. Among the tools discussed: Hackfoldr (open source multi-level bookmarking), Loomio (online consensus decision-making), Hacked and Ethercalc (for realtime document sharing), and Pol.is (a non-hierarchical commenting platform).


Our friends at GovLab are out with a big new report on the four key ways that open data is changing the world: by improving government, empowering citizens, creating opportunity, and solving public problems.


The Political TV Ad Archive has launched courtesy of the folks at the Internet Archive, chock-a-block with more than 30,000 ads from the early 2016 primary states, along with the data on how often it aired, where and when. (Congrats to our friends Roger MacDonald, Nancy Watzman, and Dan Schultz!)


Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent every year by the philanthropic sector for improving voter education, registration, election administration and civic participation, voter turnout in the United States is stagnant or declining, Kelly Born of the Hewlett Foundation writes for Stanford Social Innovation Review. Its the introduction to a series of 15 forthcoming pieces examining what the social sector can do to improve turnout, that were looking forward to reading.


Imprisoned Iraq War whistleblower Chelsea Manning gave a rare interview to artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, which BoingBoing has published. In it she talks about her view of big data, data mining, transparency and related subjects. She says, we need laws that actually promote openness. We need transparency laws. Such laws would not be the Orwellian, ironically named Freedom of Information laws that local, state, and the federal governments regularly use to deny information. Instead, these would be open records laws that would allow the public to quickly and efficiently examine what is going on in their government in their own neighborhoods, towns, cities, and states.


How we live today: Silicon Valley whiz-kids are running out of real problems that they can solve. Or shall we say, real First World problems. Thats the underlying point of Sarah Kesslers snarky and funny piece for Fast Company about the new batch of gas-delivery start-ups that are hoping to top off your cars tank for you. (Shes got liquor-delivery, suitcase-packing, and on-demand laundry service in there too.)


President Obama has a thing for tech gadgets, Michael Shear reports for the New York Times.


Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has posted a story to Medium (where else?!) titled, At 83, I Decided to Develop an App. Its for a version of solitaire. The comments on his post, starting with one by Medium cartoonist Matt Bors, are, shall we say, to die for.


Another longtime friend (and Civic Hall member), Zephyr Teachout, has announced that she is running for Congress, as Jesse McKinley reports for the New York Times. Shes tackling the same upstate New York congressional district that stymied Sean Eldridge (Chris Hughes husband) in 2014, but this time the incumbent Republican congressman Chris Gibson is stepping down.

Word games: Longtime readers know that I have regularly railed against claims that such-and-such a tool can provide meaningful sentiment analysis of online postings. Language is notoriously squirrelly, after all, and when it comes to political statements, people often employ a variety of tricksespecially sarcasmto shade or emphasize a point. Well, now come two computer scientist Ph.D.s from Carnegie Mellon with a serious paper suggesting that they have figured out how to detect sarcasm on Twitter with 95 percent accuracy. (Yeah, right.) Their solution is to train their algorithm with a set of tweets marked by their writers with the word sarcasm or sarcastic, and then to add additional filters that tend to strongly indicate sarcasm. My favorites, in case you want to start confusing your readers, are word unigrams like dare, shocked, clearly, #lol and gasp, and bigrams include you mean, how dare, im shocked, im sure and at all.

Cruz, to his credit, takes Slack seriously (after accepting a gift of a light saber) but then insists that campaign finance reform is just about protecting incumbents and preventing the people from having a voice.

This is civic tech: News from Datamades Derek Eder: Chicago Councilmatic has just relaunched, tracking all things related to the Chicago City Council, joining its cousin NYC Councilmatic.


GovTech.com and Dustin Haisler and Paul Taylor of e.Republic have put together the GovTech100, a list of 100 companies focused on servicing government customers, having developed an innovative or disruptive offering to improve or transform government, or having created new models for delivering services. These companies are active in one or more market segments: administrative, service delivery, intelligent infrastructure and civic tech focus areas.


DemocracyOS, the open-source deliberation platform that originated in Argentina, has a posse in France, as Virgil Deville describes.


93 percent of 89 U.S. mayors from 31 states surveyed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual Menino survey say they are in favor of police wearing body cameras.


Asked about infrastructure needs for their cities, these mayors identified roads, mass transit, and water/wastewater/stormwater as their top priorities were they to get an unrestricted grant to pay for a large project. Broadband was at the bottom of their lists. (The word technology never appears in the full report.)


Asked what three cities these mayors had recently looked to for policy ideas, the top three responses were, in order, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. (h/t NY city councilman Brad Lander)


Privacy watch: Speaking of our inspiring city, really high-speed free Wi-Fi is coming to New York City via the new LinkNYC network being built by the CityBridge consortium, and while the networks speed and availability is going to surprise a lot of users, the Wall Street Journals Joanna Stern warns that you better take some common-sense steps to secure your communications before you join in the party.

Jenna McLaughlin explains in The Intercept why the White Houses recent request of major social network companies like Facebook that they use their algorithms for spotting terrorist content online is highly unlikely to work. The main problem: acts of terror are exceedingly rare. She writes, Many experts, including people with law enforcement, academic, and scientific backgrounds, agree that its practically impossible to boil down the essential predictive markers that make up a terrorist who is willing and capable of carrying out an attack and then successfully pick him out of a crowd.


What sharing economy?: A Pennsylvania State University study funded by the hotel industry found that 39 percent of all the revenue generated by Airbnb guests in 12 major metropolitan areas over a thirteen month period in 2014-15 went to landlords operating more than one unit, Patrick Clark reports for Bloomberg Business.


Diversity blues: Silicon Valley companies say they want to hire more blacks, but as Vauhini Vara reports for Bloomberg Business, getting young coders from an elite historically black college like Howard University jobs at major tech firms is a lot more complicated.

While many of the people named definitely are players in the political tech sector (oddly missing: the team from Revolution Messaging that is powering Bernie Sanders internal tech), Wired cant help but puff them beyond recognition. Its a silly, silly exercise, starting with this disconnected-from-reality statement: 2016 is the election when Silicon Valleyits players, its policy priorities, and, oh yes, its moneyfinally upstages the old 20th-century power structure and seizes control of the political game. (So that means the top candidates are all in favor of liberalizing immigration policy and strong encryption, right, like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz?)

Caveat emptor: It isnt just screens that know what clothing is being tried on. This brings new meaning to tag sales.

The annual Burson-Marsteller Twiplomacy study is expanding this year to include other platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Yesterday, they released the the first installment, which covers the use of Facebook by world leaders and their governments.


The report is as full and detailed as ever, even if judging governments and leaders by their social media presence has its limits. (I, for example, would rather judge my presidents effectiveness by something other than Facebook interactions.) Burson-Marsteller found that Barack Obama and Indias Narendra Modi were the Most Liked world leaders, as determined by the number of page likes. Argentinas new President Mauricio Macri was found to be the Most Engaged, with the highest interactions to fan ratio, followed by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Israels Benjamin Netanyahu. Narendra Modi and Turkeys Recep Tayyip Erdogan topped the list of Most Effective world leaders, meaning that they had the highest average number of interactions per post.


I reached out to Burson-Marsteller to ask about bots and whether evidence of bot activity was found or taken into consideration in the results, and a representative replied, We did see some strange activity on one or two accounts but we cannot say for certain whether this was due to bots or if the organisation simply paid to promote the account or the posts with Facebook ads. Since Facebook will not release that information we decided not to mention this. According to the press release, additional installments to the 2016 Twiplomacy study will be released each month until the full study is published in May.

On Sunday, Slack co-founder and chief executive Stewart Butterfield emailed Slack employees to remind them of the significance of the upcoming Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. In the email, published in full here, he writes, Despite the fact there have been areas of progress great and small, [the civil rights movement] is still, shamefully, far from finished. And it is on all of us to see it through. There is only us, the people. And if we truly value solidarity at this company it is a good time to recognize, and remember, and recommit to standing with the people who lost their livelihoods, their limbs, and even their lives, merely asking for something as simple and basic and obvious as equal rights and equal protections under the law. Its quite a statement.

The proposed bill in New York to require state smartphone vendors to sell only phones that can be decrypted or unlocked by the manufacturer or OS provider has had one unexpected boon: it has drawn New Yorkers attention to, and even generated excitement about, the NYSenate.gov relaunch (which I wrote about last October) and how New Yorkers can use it to express support (aye) or rejection (nay) of proposed legislation, as Zack Whittaker has encouraged ZDNet readers to do.


For the Chicago Tribunes innovation vertical, Amina Elahi reports that Chicagos civic tech scene has in many ways stalled, which Smart Chicago Collaboratives Dan ONeil attributes to a disconnect between activists in the street and civic technologists. This extends to campaign tech, too: There may not be a game-changer in political technology this election cycle as campaigns lean on the widely available and affordable data analytics tools and techniques pioneered by Obamas campaigns in 2008 and 2012, Elahi concludes.


I Quant NYs Ben Wellington crunched the numbers again and found that 28 percent of New York City is not patrolled by the closest precinct house. Reasons that might matter? First of all, it would perhaps make reporting crimes easier, because the logical place to go would be the closest precinct house. Then, Wellington also wonders whether centrally-located precinct houses could improve community-police relations.


Data visualization company 1point21 Interactive has created a map that clearly shows the 6 to 1 ratio of gun dealers to Starbucks in the United States, Tanvi Misra writes for CityLab.

Speaking of Twitter, over at Motherboard, Sarah Jeong has written a thorough and fairly engrossing history of Twitters Rules, from the first 568 to the now 1,334, and all the little additions and subtractions in between. She concludes, in part: In a way, things were easier when Twitter was still the free speech wing of the free speech party. In the golden age of Twitters free speech brand, the company was often lauded for doing the hard thing when standing up to governments worldwide. In retrospect, this corporate hardheadedness was easier to pull off than what theyre doing now, where speech is policed in the name of free speech...The Twitter of today strikes an uneasy balance between its old self and the unapologetic, ideologically-unburdened censoriousness of Facebook and Instagram. It remains yet to be seen whether the company has the vision and creativity to live out its new identity. Its well worth a stroll down memory lane.


In other Twitter news, the widow of an American killed in a terrorist attack in Jordan is suing Twitter for violating the Anti-Terrorism Act, Jonathan Stempel and Alison Frankel report for Reuters.


The app Stolen, which allowed users to collect and trade Twitter profiles, has shut down after being overwhelmed with complaints and concerns about the potential for harassment and abuse. If, like me, you dont understand what the appeal was in the first place, or you want a better understanding of all the things that could or did go wrong, Holly Brockwell interviewed Siqi Chen, the CEO of the company behind Stolen, for Gadgette.


Its never too late for resolutions: Although we missed it when it originally went up, an email from 18Fs Melody Kramer drew our attention to a blog post she co-wrote with Britta Gustafson on 18Fs New Years resolutions, which include developing metrics for measuring progress, improving documentation, improving communication when asking for help; asking for help, make it easier to contribute and to reuse tools theyve built; etc. The full list is worth a perusal.

A United Nations report finds that technology and the world wide web have not led to universalor even expandedprosperity, health, and happiness, as many hoped, Somini Sengupta reports for the New York Times. In fact, she writes, the reports warns that innovations stand to widen inequalities and even hasten the hollowing out of middle-class employment. The World Bank reports that countries with the resources to acquire and invest in technologies will reap significant dividends but that others will fall behind, and without a strong foundation technology can lead to divergent economic fortunes, higher inequality, and an intrusive state.


 The German government has released a new smartphone app designed to help refugees seeking asylum in Germany, Amar Toor reports for The Verge. The app includes a basic German language course, information on the asylum application process, suggestions for finding employment or job training, and explanations of German values and social customs.


Tech and the presidentials: In my latest at Civicist, I talk to Change.orgs founder and CEO Ben Rattray about the new elections platform launched today, Change Politics. The ultimate goal of the platform, Rattray says, is to undercut the influence of money in politics by raising the importance of trusted endorsements over paid advertising.


Yesterday was the third annual Big Block of Cheese Day at the White House, and Americans were invited to ask questions on Twitter using #BigBlockofCheeseDay. Wireds Issie Lapowsky calls the tradition, lifted from The West Wing, truly insipid Twitter, and gives some convincing examples of lackluster interactions.


Shahid Buttar writes in the Electronic Frontier Foundation blog that President Obamas State of the Union address failed to mention mass surveillance by the National Security Agency, and outlines how little has changed during Obamas tenure, in spite of the Snowden revelations or Obamas campaign promises to rethink the security policies enacted under George W. Bush.


Peers.org co-founder Natalie Foster takes to Medium to explain what big idea she thought was buried in Obamas State of the Union address: benefits that move with people. She lists a number of labor leaders, company execs, and venture capitalists who support the idea of portable benefits, and expresses her hope that a better, more flexible safety net is in the works.


The Rideshare Guy, Harry Campbell, a former aerospace engineer and a part-time Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar driver turned blogger, takes a look at Ubers low retention rate and whether or not the company will ever run out of drivers.

Yesterday, Al Jazeera America announced that the cable news channel and digital operations will shut down by the end of April, Glenn Greenwald reports for The Intercept.


A new Pew Research Center report finds that Americans are willing to share personal information or allow other intrusions into their privacy, like office surveillance cameras, if they think the tradeoff is worth it. One scenario participants were polled on was Free social media: A new social media platform is being used by your former high school to help manage communications about a class reunion...if you choose to participate, you will be creating a profile using your real name and sharing a photo of yourself. Your access to the service is free, but your activity on the site would be used by the site to deliver advertisements it hopes will be appealing to you. A whopping 51 percent of participants said this was not acceptable. This was not always because of the privacy infringements; one participant reported, I have enough social media sites to manage. Id rather they use Facebook, and another wrote, I have no desire to keep in contact with people from high school. The lengthy report has lots more tidbits about when and why Americans will surrender personal information,


As interesting as the report is, it isnt super revolutionary information. In 2014, an artist found 380 New Yorkers who were willing to give up everything from fingerprints to partial Social Security numbers in exchange for a cookie.

Sharing and organizing: A new report from RSA on the sharing economy says it sees good news ahead. As Brhmie Balaram writes, we are seeing the development of sharing platforms that are co-operative and decentralised in nature, and able to forgo intermediaries completely with the help of blockchain technology. While these platforms are in their infancy, they hold promise for workers who will be able to truly free themselves from under the thumb of a middleman and fully retain their earnings.

Their article has a dry-as-bones title, but Open Data and Civic Apps: First-Generation Failures, Second Generation Improvements by Melissa Lee, Esteve Almirall, and Jonathan Wareham is an excellent and clear-eyed look at apps contests built on open government data and how civic hacktivists are evolving smarter strategies for making civic tech that matters.

Todays civic tech must-read: mySociety researcher Emily Shaw gives her take on the defining-civic-tech debate. Heres the key graf, IMO:
[I]n the field we are building a clear definition of civic tech. It has to do with the way we believe we improve democratic self-management. We want to improve everyones ability to transmit information about their preferences into government. We want to improve everyones ability to get the information they want out of government. And we want to see what happens as information is processed in the middle. Civic technology seeks to improve government input/output, while opening the process to full view.

I see absolutely no point in pretending that its not going to happen. Im fully confident that copyright, for instance, will no longer exist in 10 years, and authorship and intellectual property is in for such a bashing. Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity. So its like, just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again. Youd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because thats really the only unique situation thats going to be left. Its terribly exciting. But on the other hand it doesnt matter if you think its exciting or not; its whats going to happen.

Todays civic tech must-read: Like many other cities, Madison, Wisconsin, decided to open up public data back in 2012, responding to the rising demand from local civic hackers. But as Laurel White reports for the Capital Times, Almost exactly three years later, while other cities have built thriving partnerships between civic hackers and municipal government, Madisons civic hacking and open data communities are almost dead. As he reports, resistance from stubborn city bureaucrats about releasing useful datasetsthe city foresters office had security concerns about the release of data about ash trees!?

Government opening: Set aside your cynicism and take a look at this post by Joseph Feti from the Open Government Partnership, exploring many of the reasons why the highfaluting promises made by OGP countries to be more transparent and accountable dont get implemented. My favorite reasons:

Start date happens after the action plan ends...Believe it or not, some commitments have a start date in 2017 for a 2013-2015 action plan.
No one is holding anyone else responsible. IRM [Independent Reporting Mechanism] researchers are regularly surprised at how few governments have internal tracking systems (like spreadsheets) to check in with commitment leads.
Vested interests: the Commitment would disadvantage someone high in the administration (or legislature) who would suffer loss due to commitment being completed.

Long-form: Twitter is considering offering its users a 10,000 character limit, up from 140, Kurt Wagner reports for Re/Code. More details from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, here.
On Slate, Will Oremus hot take is that this means Twitter is trying to build a wall to encompass stories that its users may post. Thats because Twitter is struggling to compete with rivals like Snapchat, Instagram, and Tumblr, all of which are designed to keep users in rather than continually sending them out to the broader Web to view content, he writes.
Tech and the presidentials: Donald Trump may appear to be winging his campaign, only beginning to pour millions into traditional TV ads this week. But as Kenneth Vogel and Darren Samuelsohn report for Politico, for several months he actually has been working with an experienced data team to build sophisticated models to transform fervor into votes. True to form, Politico is hyping this story by calling it Trumps data juggernaut but so far the operation looks more like a data rickshaw.
MoveOn.org Political Action is launching a formal vote of its membership to see if should endorse a presidential candidate, starting tomorrow, its executive director Ilya Sherman announced. The group, which has an online membership of about 8 million, endorsed Barack Obama in 2008.
This is civic tech: Capitol Bells launched a new Reddit-like civic engagement mobile app yesterday, and its founder Ted Henderson celebrated with an AMA on Reddit along with Alex Ebert, the lead singer of the band Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, who also happens to be a civic hacker (say what?!).
Judging from the user comments, folks were a lot more interested in Ebert than Henderson, which is a shame because Capitol Bells new app is pretty intriguing. On top of giving users instantaneous updates about pending House or Senate votes, and allowing them to compare their preferences to their representatives (a trope of nearly every such app), CB also has a Lobby where users can anonymously post and poll each other on political gossip. (Think of that as Brigade without the real-name policy.) That said, Eberts new site, The New IRS, is also worth checking out. It gives users the opportunity to allocate government tax collections how they would like them to be spent and then compare that to the actual breakdown of government spending. He describes it as a virtuality. an experience of a more powerful democracy, a talking piece, and a data collection point.
Heres Eberts vision (per his AMA): Political engagement must become facile, swift, and the results must feel and be immediately tangible  just like life. tech facilitates worldwide instantaneousness  a virtual town hall the world over  meaning real participatory democracy is, now, possible. Dude!
Heres Eberts song for Bernie Sanders, The Bern. Should he stick to his day job?

Todays civic tech must-read: The founder of the Govtech Fund, Ron Bouganim, has penned an excellent update on the state of govtech, which he defines as the operating system for governmentthe infrastructure and tools government agencies use everyday to do their jobs. He says the field is booming, thanks to a number of trends including government adoption of the cloud, budget constraints, a massive government personnel retirement cycle and an open data movement have coalesced to create an openness on the part of government agencies to embrace new technologies and a dramatically shortened sales cycle. And he helpfully distinguishes govtech from civic tech, the operating system of the citizen, in which he includes community organizing, petitions, advocacy, connecting with elected officials, politics and campaigns, the citizen journalist, and much more.
Speaking of community organizing, a group of longtime feminist online organizers, including Civic Hall members Deanna Zandt of Lux Digital and Jeanne Brooks of Datakind, along with Tracy Van Slyke of Culture Lab and Sabrina Hersi Issa of Be Bold Media (longtime Personal Democracy Media friends all, I should add), have launched ShineSquad to organize a systemic response to the problem of sexual harassment and assault in social change organizations, as Juana Summers reports for Mashable. Their effort is a direct response to the collapse of FitzGibbon Media but is rooted in a much longer and largely hidden history of abuse and neglect of the issue.
The Sunlight Foundations president, Christopher Gates, is stepping down, the organizations co-founder Michael Klein announced yesterday. Stepping in as interim executive director is longtime Sunlight policy director John Wonderlich. We wish the best of luck to them both!
Trump watch: Donald Trumps new TV ad, the first of his presidential campaign, which you should not ignore because it is going to play constantly in Iowa and New Hampshire for the next few weeks, blatantly conflates being Muslim with being a terrorist, and shows ominous pictures of dark-skinned people while promising to build a border fence that Mexico will pay for. Despite the ads explicit racism, many political commentators have generally confined themselves to asking whether it will be effective. As if they were in the 1930s covering the German parliamentary elections like they were a normal event: Wolf Blitzer: How do you think the new radio ad the Nazis have been runningthe one where they blame the Jews for the economic collapse and Germanys weakness in the worldis going to play as we head into the final weeks of the election, panel? Cokie Roberts: Well, honestly Wolf, the tone is a bit strong but its clearly working for Adolf. German voters seem attracted to his tell-it-like-it-is style. Mark Halperin: Its just another amazing piece of work by Goebbels. Hes really got his finger on the pulse of the German electorate. Etc. etc.
Or, theyve tried to fact-check it, as Politifacts C. Eugene Emery Jr. and Louis Jacobson point out, its image of people swarming a border is actually from footage of migrants trying to cross from Morocco to Spain, and marked the ad pants on fire. Asked about that supposed error, his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told NBC News, No shits not the Mexican border but thats what our country is going to look like. This was 1,000 percent on purpose.
Among the Eight Causes of Trumpism, longtime political commentator Norman Ornstein writes in the Atlantic, one must count the internet. He blames it for a dramatic deterioration of civil discourse and social standards (i.e. comment pages and chat rooms where nothing is too course or off limits anymore), the ease with which conspiracy theorists can now engage in collective action (i.e. Here Comes Every Birther!), and the rise of echo chambers where we can all actively seek out the information sources [we] wantand actively avoid those that provide dissonant information.
Brave new world: Liberty Mutual has just launched a new partnership with Subaru, offering drivers discounts for installing and abiding by a car app that tells them when they are accelerating or braking too fast, and Brian Fung of the Washington Post uses that news to offer a warning about how these new usage-tracking technologies may also endanger drivers privacy, lead to new kinds of legal liabilities and potentially higher rates for non-compliance.
Security researchers believe a power failure that hit regional power authorities in Ukraine last week was caused by malicious code designed to sabotage industrial control systems, Dan Goodin reports for ArsTechnica.

News feeders: Politicos Nancy Scola offers a smart look at why so many political players are turning to Medium to post their thoughts, rather than running the gauntlet of old medias op-ed editors. (I have to add: isnt Medium just the Huffington Post with a much better publishing platform and less of an overtly liberal slant?)
On Medium (naturally), Andrew Hayward of MIT Media Labs Electome project offers some first findings from the projects comparison of political news coverage to Twitter conversation (in English) related to the presidential election. Given that Electome has access to the full Twitter hose, theres good reason to expect some fresh insights here from exploring what Twitter users talk about compared to what the media focuses on, but count me dissatisfied so far. Heyward gives us some pretty charts that imply that Electomes data scientists have figured out how to measure such things as Donald Trumps percentage share of media coveragewhen in fact they are only looking at 12 news publications, not the entire universe of news media. Nor does he explain how his team counts the coverage a candidate gets when they are one of several mentioned in a story, or how they weight headlines vs text. But hey, its big data, so enjoy!
CrowdTangle tracks engagement on Facebook, and here lists the top ten progressive Facebook pages in terms of the total engagement they drove in 2015.

No, we havent heard of any of them.

I dont think Ive read a more cogent analysis of just what irks Donald Trump than this witty essay from Megan Carpentier in The Guardian, commenting on his recent declaration that Hillary Clinton had been schlonged in 2008 by Barack Obama: ...in 2015, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination has admitted that hes grossed out by the thought of women urinating, hes disgusted by breast-feeding, he thinks menstruation is a mind-altering phenomenon, and he thinks that the best rhetorical method for referring to a womans campaign loss is to evoke mental images of her getting bested by a penis. One would think that a man who likes to build skyline-altering, metal-and-glass phalluses and slap his name on them couldnt pantomime his sexual insecurities any louder.
Tech and the presidentials: Believe it or not, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both agree about the role of technology in fighting terrorismand theyre equally wrong about it. Thats Brian Fungs point in this smart piece for the Washington Post, where he argues that they each are advocating policies that display a common ignorance about how the Internet and online communications actually work and a naive faith in cyber geniuses. I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts, Clinton said at Saturdays Democratic presidential debate, regarding their ability to solve the encryption dilemma.

Tech and the presidentials: Hillary Clintons campaign is still angry about how Bernie Sanders campaign is talking about the NGP-VAN data breach, especially at insinuations suggesting that they too may have accessed data inappropriately, Jennifer Epstein reports for Bloomberg Politics.
NGP-VANs chief competitors, John Phillips of Aristotle and Jim Gilliam of NationBuilder, both sound off in this New York Times story by Emma Roller on the controversy. They argue that individual campaigns should control their own data, not parties. (Note to NYTimes editorswhen quoting competitors of a company, shouldnt they be described as such?)

System reboot: The first Democratic presidential primary data war ended quickly, with the Democratic National Party officials restoring access to the national voter file to the Bernie Sanders campaign Saturday morning, and Sanders apologizing personally to Hillary Clinton at the start of Saturdays Democratic presidential debate. But as Bloomberg Politics Michael Bender, Jennifer Epstein and Andrew Harris report, the grudging settlement of the dispute came after a day of recriminations. That included the Sanders campaign suing the DNC in federal court, and the Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook charging that their data was stolen.
Indeed, it remains unclear whether the Sanders team actually took advantage of the temporary failure of NGP-VANs firewall to access actual lists of voters that the Clinton campaign had identified, or just summaries of those lists. As Pat Reynard writes for the Iowa Starting Line blog, the search logs made available by NGP-VAN show that Josh Uretsky, the fired Sanders data director, ran multiple searches for 40 minutes of Clinton turnout and persuasion scores in key early states which he calls an obvious attempt to glean valuable data from your rival. He adds, Running lists of turnout scores can tell you how many people the Clinton campaign believes will turn out to caucus. Querying their persuasion scores can get you a rough estimate of how many supporters they think they have in a state.

Politicos Nancy Scola explains the history of NGP-VAN and why nearly every Democratic campaign uses it.
The Sanders campaign has suspended two additional staffers involved in accessing the Clinton campaigns data, Fredrik Schouten reports for USA Today.
The Clinton campaign is still highly vexed over the possibility that Sanders team got an unfair advantage from the data breach, as Clinton pollster Joel Benenson told Glenn Thrush and Annie Karnie of Politico. I dont think any of us will know until this audit is completed how serious this all is, Benenson said. All of [the data] is extremely valuable, it is work produced by tens of thousands of volunteers. ... it is part of a roadmap to how we are running and strategizing in our campaign and how we get to the totals we need to win in Iowa and New Hampshire, especially,
Top Democratic campaign veterans had lots to say about the controversy, though some of them were hardly objective observers. For example, former Obama 2012 national field director Jeremy Bird of 270 Strategies tweeted They stole millions of dollars of research. This isnt a small thing.
Jim Messina, who ran Obamas 2012 campaign, tweeted, Sanders camp reaction is silly. Fess up, apologize, and move on. Rule breakers arent victims. (Bird and Messina both worked for the Ready for Hillary Super PAC.)
Former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, now advising Uber, tweeted, Think if one company accessed and stole anothers customer data. This is no small thing. Sanders camp should be careful playing the victim. (Plouffe endorsed Clinton in October.)
Taking everything down a notch, Brigade VP Adam Conner (and a longtime Personal Democracy Media friend) writes a tongue-in-cheek version of All the Presidents Data. Best line comes from Carl Bernstein: So what exactly got stolen again? Some kind of files? How much paper are we talking here? Boxes? Enough to fill the van?
While the data war dies down, journalists and editorial writers looking for a larger lesson in what seems to be the ultimate inside baseball story might ponder this question: How do national voter files filled with fine-grained data points on the political preferences of hundreds of millions of voters, combined with sophisticated data analytics, change politics? Add in the psychographic modeling and behavioral targeting reportedly being perfected by Ted Cruzs campaign, and what role is left for ordinary citizens?
Political technologist Michael Marinaccio raises a bunch of related questions about whether big data in politics is going to far, giving this as one example of whats now possible: I sat in a recent meeting where we were discussing potential messages to use and were planning to segment two different audiences and send them similar, but opposing messages. (Newsflash: it is insanely normal these days to send your pro-life segment a Yes, Pro-life! message while sending your pro-choice crowd a Yes, Womens health! one.)
Why you have to read the small print: If you ever bought anything from the Delaware Crossing online Americana store, you may not realize it but you were shopping from the National Republican Campaign Committee, which now has your data, as Theodoric Meyer reports for Politico.

Welcome to the data-driven campaign: Bernie Sanders presidential campaign has lost its access to the Democratic partys 50-state voter file after its staff allegedly accessed internal voter data from Hillary Clintons campaign that became available while NGP-VAN, the company that manages the file on behalf of the party, was applying a software patch Wednesday, Rosalind Helderman, Anne Gearan, and John Wagnerr report for the Washington Post. The DNC has blocked Sanders use of the voter file until it provides an explanation as well as assurances that all Clinton data has been destroyed, they report. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the campaign didnt download or print any data and is blaming NGP-VAN for the breach.
The Sanders campaign has fired one staffer involved in the incident, who accessed some modeling data from another campaign, its spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement. But, as Maggie Habermas and Nick Corasaniti report for the New York Times, ...according to three people with direct knowledge of the breach, there were four user accounts associated with the Sanders campaign that ran searches while the security of Mrs. Clintons data was compromised.
Covering the same news for BuzzFeed, Evan McMorris-Santoro and Ruby Cramer report that it was the Sanders staff that alerted NGP-VAN of the breakdown of its firewall between the campaigns. As they note, The incident could pose a devastating setback for Sanders so close to the start of the Democratic primary: Until access is restored to the NGP-VAN, the candidates organizers will have to perform the basic functions of the field programphone banks, voter contact, visibilitywithout an electronic system centralizing their efforts.
The staffer who was fired, Josh Uretsky, told CNNs Dan Merica that he wasnt trying to access any proprietary Clinton data, but just trying to understand how badly the Sanders campaigns data was exposed. He added, We knew there was a security breach in the data, and we were just trying to understand it and what was happening. To the best of my knowledge, nobody took anything that would have given the (Sanders) campaign any benefit....This wasnt the first time we identified a bad breach in the NGP-VAN system. In retrospect, I got a little panicky because our data was totally exposed, too. We had to have an assessment, and understand of how broad the exposure was and I had to document it so that I could try to calm down and think about what actually happened so that I could figure out how to protect our stuff.
NGP-VANs president Stu Trevelyan posts a statement this morning explaining that the data breach was quite limited. For a brief window, the voter data that is always searchable across campaigns in VoteBuilder included client scores it should not have, on a specific part of the VAN system. So for voters that a user already had access to, that user was able to search by and view (but not export or save or act on) some attributes that came from another campaign.
Former Obama campaign data director Ethan Roeder tells Civicist that Its becoming increasingly apparent to me, the more I learn about this story, that theres no there there, explaining that theres little information the Sanders campaign could have usefully gleaned from seeing some Clinton voter scores.
The DNCs decision to cut off the Sanders campaign access to the national voter file is highly unlikely to last long, in my humble opinion. If it does, it will undermine the confidence of many other lower level Democratic candidates in using NGP-VANs vaunted system. As Ben Jacobs writes for the Guardian, The move by the DNC raises eyebrows as many Democrats, including Sanders and fellow presidential candidate Martin OMalley, have long accused the DNCs chair, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, of attempting to rig the presidential process to benefit Clinton. In particular, they have raised questions about the relative paucity of debates, which have been scheduled for weekend evenings and to coincide with other events such as a major University of Iowa football game.
As Simon Rosenberg of the New Democratic Network tweeted this morning, [I] am not a Sanders supporter, but cutting off his campaign from data access after their own software errors an extreme act by DNC.

Multiple female employees have come forward with accusations. Perhaps most disturbing, they report that FitzGibbon was previously disciplined, but not fired, when accused of harassment while he was working at Fenton Communications. After the accusation and the firms investigation, other female employees came forward with similar harassment complaints, they report.

The world is on fire: Five years ago today, a Tunisian vegetable seller named Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire after a policewoman confiscated his cart and insulted him, an event that set off the Arab Spring. That woman, Faida Hamdy, tells the Telegraphs Radhouane Addala and Richard Spencer, Sometimes I wish Id never done it. Bouazizis sister Samia tells them that My brother is a lover of life and he would have rejected both the stupid politicians and death-loving extremists. My brother died for dignity, not for wealth or an ideology.

Related: In Foreign Affairs, Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman explain how the European Court of Justices ending of the Safe Harbor agreement allowing American firms to circumvent tough European data privacy rules is rooted in Continental unhappiness with the NSAs surveillance overreach. They write:
By transforming U.S. technology companies into tools of national intelligence, Washington has badly damaged their corporate reputations and exposed them to foreign sanctions. Their international profitsnot to mention a substantial chunk of the U.S. economydepend on the free flow of information across borders. Foreign officials, political activists, and judges who limit these flows to protect their citizens from U.S. surveillance strike at the heart of these companies business models. The ECJs Safe Harbor ruling has now forced Washington to decide whether it values its unrestricted ability to spy on Europeans more than an open Internet and the economic well-being of powerful U.S. businesses.

As he notes, Facewatch lets you share subjects of interest with other Facewatch users even if they havent been convicted. If you look at the shop owner in a funny way, or ask for the service charge to be removed from your bill, you might find yourself added to the subject of interest list.

Government as its own worst enemy: The Government Accountability Office has found that the EPA engaged in covert propaganda when it rolled out a social media campaign on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Thunderclap to battle public opposition to its clean water rule, Eric Lipton and Michael Shear report for the New York Times front page. While government agencies are allowed to promote their policies as long as their role in doing so is disclosed, the GAO found that using Thunderclap violated the law because as the promoted Thunderclap message spread online across Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, people receiving wouldnt have known it came from the EPA. I can guarantee you that general counsels across the federal government are reading this report, Michael Eric Hertz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York, commented. And thats not a good thing for everyone who wants government to open up more by using social media.
The GAO says (on page 13 of its letter to Senator Jim Inhofe, who requested its investigation into the EPA) the problem with how the agency used Thunderclap is that While EPAs role was transparent to supporters who joined the campaign [by signing up for the Thunderclap], this does not constitute disclosure to the 1.8 million people potentially reached by the Thunderclap. To those people, it appeared that their friend independently shared a message of his or her support for EPA and clean water. This is a truly odd way to think about how information spreads today thanks to the online public sphere: back in pre-internet days, if the Surgeon General said smoking was dangerous to your health, and then some random person used that same phrase in a newspaper story or a conversation over the office water cooler, no one thought that was covert propaganda. It was just the effect of an idea spreading, one that happened to come from an authoritative government source.
The GAO also slammed the EPA for a blog post about the impact of clean water on surfers and brewers by a communications staffer that including links to two advocacy organizations (the NRDC and the Surfrider Foundation) who were themselves supportive of the clean water rule. Both of those third-party sites included calls to take action, including buttons that would take a user through the process of contacting Congress, leading the GAO to conclude that the EPA had violated anti-lobbying provisions of relevant legislation.
Both of these rulings by the GAO are likely to chill government communications offices and cause them to pull back from engaging in the online public sphere. Lets hear it for nitpicky government lawyers. Its worth remembering that back in 2008, when questions arose about the Department of Defenses years-long plying of retired military officers with special conference calls, meetings, paid travel and privileged access to senior Pentagon officials, all in service of helping to generate favorable news coverage of the Bush administrations war efforts, the GAO found that there was no evidence of any covert propaganda effort, since the Pentagon didnt specifically contract with or pay those retired officers for positive commentary. (The fact that many of these same ex-officers were simultaneously employed by major defense contractors as lobbyists was deemed beyond the scope of the GAOs investigation, as was the fact that the Pentagon spent millions to carefully track what they said to media outlets.)
So, just to be clear: if a government agency gets Americans to voluntarily share its message on social media and doesnt disclose in every instance of that messages appearance that it came from the agency, thats covert propaganda according to the Government Accounting Office. But if a government agency gets Americans to voluntarily share its message in news media and doesnt disclose in every instance that they wined and dined these Americans, who they handpicked because they knew they already shared the agencys point of view, thats...just fine.
While were pissed off at government, department of: The Internet Archives Brewster Kahle has posted an angry open letter to the National Credit Union Administration, announcing the voluntary liquidation of his Internet Credit Union project, and its quite a doozy.
Tech and the presidential: It will be interesting to see how the presidential candidates try to insinuate themselves into this weeks big cultural event, the release of the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens. Already, Ted Cruz is calling on users of his mobile engagement app to step up their volunteering in the hopes of winning tickets to see the film opening weekend. Cruz tells ABC News, I grew up on Star Wars. I collected all the Star Wars action figures, I had them all in a Darth Vader carrying case and with my friends we would play and fight them back and forth. I had a giant millennium falcon.
By the way, now that we know that everything the Cruz campaign does is shaped by behavioral scientists testing the effects of different messages on targeted audiences, it becomes possible to read his campaign moves in a whole new way. Call it reverse engineering of data targeting. Thus, last weeks New York Times story by Matt Flegenheimer about Cruzs efforts in Iowa to Make Friends with Ordinary People becomes more understandable. As Flegenheimer reported, While many candidates stick to their stump speech script, a Cruz performance can appear obsessively calibrated, down to the dramatic pauses deployed identically from event to event. He is folksy by memorization, ticking off tales of college football woe or a drawling West Texas farmer with the precision of mass repetition.
This Des Moines Register story by Jennifer Jacobs suggests that Donald Trumps ground game in the state may be faltering, though it is using the Ground Game 2 mobile canvassing app.

Tech and the presidential: Ted Cruzs presidential campaign is now openly bragging about its use of psychographic data for voter micro targeting, as Tom Hamburger reports for the Washington Post. Using data from peoples Facebook profiles along with consumer data, the campaign tailors its outreach to individuals with care. Hamburger writes, For example, personalities that have received high scores for neuroticism are believed to be generally fearful, so a pro-gun pitch to them would emphasize the use of firearms for personal safety and might include a picture of a burglar breaking in to a home. He also nicely notes this: Cruz, a critic of excessive government data collection, has been notably aggressive about gathering personal information for his campaign.
Hate search: Using weekly Google search data from 2004 to 2013, Evan Soltas and Seth Stephens-Davidowitz write that they found a direct correlation between anti-Muslim searches and anti-Muslim hate crimes. They also estimate that negative attitudes against Muslims today are higher than prejudice against any group in any month since 2004, when Google began preserving detailed data on search volumes. The only silver lining in all their findings: after President Obama mentioned that Muslims in America include many top athletes and soldiers, searches on those word combinations also spiked.
Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, posts on Medium that Lets not let fear defeat our values. We must support Muslim and other minority communities in the US and around the world.

Steve Adler, chief information strategist of IBM, writes that, despite being a big fan of the Open Government Partnership (OGP)a signature international transparency initiative galvanized by the Obama Administratonthe entire project needs a reboot. He adds, We are increasing membership but not increasing open government, and civil society is increasingly cynical about OGP. Many are saying it is a whitewash, lipstick on a pig, giving national governments a nice pretty facade of openness behind which they write laws restricting access to executive emails, forbidding foreign funding of journalism, empowering universal surveillance, and even worse. And he asks some really good questions, like Why is an organization dedicated to transparency having secret leadership meetings?
Watching their words: Angie Drobnic Holan, a fact-checker with Politifact, offers some tantalizing evidence that the online fact-checking movement is having an impact on politicians, with some vetting their prepared statements more carefully and giving their campaign ads extra scrutiny, and media organizations highlighting fact-checking in their coverage because so many people click on fact-checking stories after a debate or high-profile news event.

Tech and the presidentials: Ted Cruzs presidential campaign, now surging, is using a data analytics firm whose prime product is a database of millions of Facebook users whose profile information was harvested largely without their permission, Harry Davies reports for The Guardian. The firm, Cambridge Analytica, which specializes in behavioral microtargeting, claims to be able to match Facebook data to existing voter data. Its Facebook database was reportedly obtained by an academic who paid Mechanical Turk users to let him access their Facebook profiles, which allowed him not only to harvest their personal data and likes, but also those of their friends.
The ACLUs chief technologist, Christopher Soghoian, said the Guardians findings were troubling, adding, What it essentially means is there is no one regulating campaigns privacy data and security practices. So it means you have a wild west, where the campaigns can do whatever they want and get away with it. Its worth noting that in 2012, the Obama campaign built a similar (but much larger) dataset of Facebook users through its Im in app and Targeted Sharing project.
A coalition of liberal and Muslim advocacy groups organized by online advocacy group CREDO Action are calling on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to back away from retired General Wesley Clark, a campaign surrogate who recently called for the internment of some American Muslims, Alex Seitz-Wald reports for MSNBC.com.

Media and democracy: If, as Craig Newmark of Craigslist likes to say, the media are the immune system of democracy, then this article by Marc Levy in the Cambridge Day, decisively debunking an attack on a local Muslim city councillor by Breitbart.com, is a great example. Were going to need a lot of this kind of journalism, because anti-Muslim hysteria in America has never been greater. Notably, the Breitbart story appeared in the sponsored news feeds of many Cambridge residents, suggesting that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergs promise to defend Muslims may need a little work.

Well, not all people. I wonder if Pfeiffer knows about GoFundMes refusal to let women use the site to fund abortions, while permitting pro-life campaigners to use it to raise money for their causes.
Oh, yeah. Remember Meerkat?

Trump watch: A very big swath of civil society in America is signing onto the We Are Better Than This statement, which decries the rising tide of hatred, violence and suspicion in America and pledges to stand with any community that is targeted by hateful rhetoric and violence. The statement was initiated by MoveOn.org, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, United We Dream, the Center for Community Change, Demos, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Arab-American Association of New York SEIU and Color of Change. Andrew Rasiej and I are signers on behalf of Civic Hall. Please add your name.
White supremacists like David Duke and Stormfront founder Don Black say Donald Trumps campaign has revitalized their movement, Politicos Ben Schreckinger reports. Black says he is upgrading Stormfronts servers to deal with the steady increase in traffic he has seen since Trump began campaigning. Hes made it ok to talk about these incredible concerns of European Americans today, because I think European Americans know they are the only group that cant defend their own essential interests and their point of view, Duke says.
An online petition aimed at the British Parliament calling for Trump to be refused entry based on laws against hate speech has received more than 400,000 signatures, well beyond the 100,000 needed for it to prompt a parliamentary debate, Dan Bilefsky reports for the New York Times.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posts that I want to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world, adding that As a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities....If youre a Muslim in this community, as the leader of Facebook I want you to know that you are always welcome here and that we will fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe environment for you.
Facebooks head of global product policy Monika Bickert has responded to a Change.org petition calling on its to do more to delete accounts supporting ISIS or praising terrorism, saying there is no place on Facebook for terrorists, terrorist propaganda, or the praising of terror.

Darth Trump is the first political mashup of the presidential season that really hits the mark, in my humble opinion.
Samir Chopra points out that part of what is driving the Donald Trump moment is a media corps that prefers sensation to substance.

Nate Silver tweets that Bernie Sanders has slightly more supporters than Trump, but Trump as gotten 23 times as much coverage on the nightly network news.
What sharing economy?: Remember that Freelancers Union study claiming that 54 million Americans are freelancers? Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, points out that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has a much lower estimate of 14.8 million self-employed workers. How to explain the difference? Mishel writes, the Freelancers Union estimate is of anyone engaged in supplemental, temporary, project- or contract-based work, within the past 12 months and even includes people who freelance but do not have any 1099 incomestretching this group beyond recognition. In contrast, the BLS estimate reflects those whose primary job is or primary income comes from self-employment. Why does this matter? Because, as Mishel carefully lays out, the Freelancers study has been used to claim that the gig economy is exploding, with tens of millions supposedly supporting themselves that way. And that doesnt appear to be the case.
Likewise, a new study from Intuit and Emergent Research finds something similar: the typical on-demand worker is a part-timer, working 12 hours a week via his or her primary platform and collecting 22 percent of their household income from work obtained through online marketplaces or applications that connect providers to customers.

Its consistent message, they write, is that the Islamic State is a social movement devoted to protecting Muslims and fighting an unfair global economic system; that it does not discriminate on the basis of race or nationality; that it uses violence in self-defense and in ways that mimic Western films and video games; and that Westerners who join the fight in Syria and Iraq are normal people fighting a just war.
Fast Companys Sarah Kessler reports on proposed legislation sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that would require social media companies to report online terrorist activist to the government. In response, the Electronic Frontier Foundations international director, Danny OBrien, said: Social media companies shouldnt take on the job of censoring speech on behalf of any government, and they certainly shouldnt do so voluntarily. These kinds of speech restrictions set online platforms on a very slippery slope. Who defines terrorism? Does Facebook, for example, intend to enforce its policies only against those that the United States government describes as terrorists, or will it also respond if Russia says someone is a terrorist? Israel? Saudi Arabia? Syria? Its particularly worrisome that were not even talking here about speech thats actually been found unlawful.

Trump watch: Donald Trumps call to stop allowing Muslims from entering the United States was denounced by most of the Republican field along with the chairmen of the Republican state parties in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Yahoo Politics Jon Ward reports.
The one major Republican presidential candidate who has so far refused to denounce Trumps proposal is Texas Senator Ted Cruz, whose rise in the polls in Iowa may have triggered Trumps latest blast, as Margaret Hartmann reports for New York magazine.
Speaking in South Carolina, Cruz only said this about Trumps call: That is not my policy. Ive introduced legislation in the Senate that would put in place a three-year moratorium on refugees coming from countries where ISIS or al Qaeda can control a substantial amount of territory. How reasonable.
It is also worth noting that until Cruzs remarks on Saturday, promising to carpet-bomb ISIS into oblivion and asserting that I dont know if sand can glow in the dark, but were going to find out, the last major American presidential candidate to suggest using nuclear weapons on one of our adversaries was Barry Goldwater, who ran in 1964. The Republican Senator from Arizona suggested using low-yield A-bombs in North Vietnam, to defoliate forests and destroy infrastructure.
In the wake of Trumps latest shart on the political process, the Huffington Posts proprietor Arianna Huffington writes that the news site will stop treating him as an entertainment topic (if you recall, the sites editors had made a big deal back in July of putting coverage of his campaign in their entertainment section). Huffington didnt mince words:
Now that Trump, aided by the media, has doubled down on the cruelty and know-nothingness that defined his campaigns early days, the can you believe he said that? novelty has curdled and congealed into something repellent and threatening  laying bare a disturbing aspect of American politics. We believe that the way we cover the campaign should reflect this shift. And part of that involves never failing to remind our audience who Trump is and what his campaign really represents.

Our borderless world: Speaking at a private fundraiser for Hillary Clintons campaign, former President Bill Clinton made a smart point about Trumps desire to insulate America from the outside world by building walls and banning immigrants: Even if Donald Trump builds his wall at the Rio Grande, the Internet will pierce it, he said, as Gabriel Debenedetti reports for Politico.
Related: Could tech companies like Facebook and Twitter do more to counter how ISIS and its supporters use social media? Thats the question at the heart of Nicole Perlroth and Mike Isaacs excellent front-page story in todays New York Times.
Opining in the New York Times online, Googles Eric Schmidt offers some interesting ideas for how to insure that the global Internet remains a force for open society: We should make it ever easier to see the news from another countrys point of view, and understand the global consciousness free from filter or bias. We should build tools to help de-escalate tensions on social media  sort of like spell-checkers, but for hate and harassment. We should target social accounts for terrorist groups like the Islamic State, and remove videos before they spread, or help those countering terrorist messages to find their voice. Without this type of leadership from government, from citizens, from tech companies, the Internet could become a vehicle for further disaggregation of poorly built societies, and the empowerment of the wrong people, and the wrong voices. Not clear from his oped is who we are and how we decide who the wrong people are.
Brendan Sasso reports for National Journal that the way Washington may (temporarily) quell the hot debate over encryption and national security is by creating a commission to study the problem.
Megan Stiles of the Campaign for Liberty warns that surveillance hawks on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in Congress are trying to push the worst provisions of both their CISA bills to President Obamas desk before the end of the year.
Back to the Internet election: Ever since an obscure Southern governor named Jimmy Carter surged to national attention by winning the Iowa caucuses in 1976, the political class has treated the state as an outsized kingmaker in our crazy-long presidential selection process. But as Emma Roller writes in a smart oped for todays New York Times, with the campaigns spending little of their money (just 3%) in Iowa, and candidates like Scott Walker, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum dropping out or teetering at the edge despite making strong pushes in Iowa, it now appears voters are more likely to engage with a candidate on Facebook or Twitter than on a rope line. This, she says, feeds a campaign process that rewards going viral and winning the media primary by being as outrageous as possible.
Following an online poll of its members, along with the votes of its nine state affiliates and four national organizational partners, the Working Families Party has endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for president. The membership vote was 87.4% for Sanders, 11.5% for Clinton and 1.1% for Martin OMalley. The party has not released a tally of how many people voted.
Democracy for America, the million-member organization that is the follow-on to Howard Deans 2004 presidential campaign, has announced an online survey of its members on who it should endorse in the Democratic presidential primary.

This is civic tech: Its been a roller-coaster of a week in America, bookended by mass shootings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado and a social service center in California. Our brains and the media nervous system that feeds (on) them are more on edge than usual, it seems. The news from last Friday, that gun sales on Black Friday broke national one-day sales records, reverberated darkly. But reflecting back on the data, and how the media covered that news, I couldnt help but notice something else: Giving Tuesday, which was founded just three years ago as a response to the mass consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, has taken off like wildfire. Its far more than a hashtag campaign. Arguably, its become the most successful civic tech culture hack of the decade. But the media, so far, isnt telling that story. To wit:

Number of gun sale background checks on Black Friday, 2015: 185,345
Number of gun sale background checks on Black Friday, 2014: 175,754
Percentage increase, year to year: 5%
Number of stories in the U.S. mainstream media touting the 2015 gun sales as an all-time record: 43
Number of donations made to non-profit organizations on Giving Tuesday, 2015: 1.08 million
Number of donations made to non-profit organizations on Giving Tuesday, 2014: 296,000
Total raised in 2015: $116.7 million
Total raised in 2014: $45.7 million
Percentage increase, year to year: 255%
Number of mainstream media stories headlining the record-breaking 2015 Giving Tuesday results: 0
Percentage of Americans who said, according to a recent poll by the Templeton Giving Survey, that they were familiar with Giving Tuesday: 18%
Percentage who said they were familiar with Black Friday: 93%


Its great to see such positive results from online donations: This is truly a cause for celebration, Henry Timms, one of the co-founders of Giving Tuesday and the executive director of 92Y, told the Chronicle of Philanthropy. In addition, beyond these numbers, there are offline donations not measured hereas well as the impact of volunteer efforts; campaigns that encourage acts of kindness or donations of goods (like food and coats); classroom programs that are growing the next generation of philanthropists; and regional campaigns in towns, cities, and states that generate civic pride and bring communities together around giving. All of those outcomes are equally important measures of success.

Next week, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Evenwel vs. Abbott, a case that challenges the use of the population equality standard for drawing state legislative districts.

The best part about this new post from Zuckerberg, where he further explains the reasoning behind making the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative an LLC (it can fund nonprofits, invest in for-profits, and engage in policy debates), is reading his responses to random comments in the thread.

Giving it away: This years Giving Tuesday broke records, with more than 1 million recorded gifts and at least $116 million raised from about 700,000 donors, its co-founder Henry Timms of the 92nd St Y reports. Thats more than double what was raised last year.
While InsidePhilanthropys David Callahan offers some tempered praise for Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chans pledge to donate most of their megazillions to charity, and in particular to promoting equality, he still thinks its darn scary. Heres why:
Todays economic inequality may be nothing compared to tomorrows civic inequality as more activist mega-donors emerge with big money and big ambitionsat a time, I should add, when government will be spiraling down into fiscal paralysis due to soaring entitlement costs as the boomers retire. If the 20th century was the era of Big Government, the 21st Century is shaping up as the age of Big Philanthropy. This power shift is one of the most important stories of our time....Close your eyes for a moment and imagine that yesterday it was the Koch brothers who had pledged to use their entire fortune (of $85 billion) to shape the direction of U.S. society. The picture would look a bit different, right? Philanthropy is not a meritocracy, nor is there a moral litmus test for entering. Anyone with enough money can play. And as more billionaires enter this gamewhether we cheer them or fear themits getting harder for the rest of us to be heard in the public square.

The New Yorkers John Cassidy points out that by (eventually) giving their Facebook stock to an LLC, Zuckerberg and Chans giving comes at a cost to the taxpayer and, arguably, to the broader democratic process. If Zuckerberg and Chan were to cash in their Facebook stock, rather than setting it aside for charity, they would have to pay capital-gains tax on the proceeds, money that could be used to fund government programs. If they willed their wealth to their descendants, then sizable estate taxes would become due on their deaths. By making charitable donations in the form of stock, they, and their heirs, will escape both of these levies.

Baby talk: In tandem with the birth of their daughter Max, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, are creating a new organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In an open letter to Max, they have pledged to donate 99 percent of their Facebook stock, currently worth more than $45 billion, to charitable purposes including personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities, as Vindu Goel and Nick Wingfield report for the New York Times.


Heres the text of the Zuckerberg-Chan letter describing their pledge to Max. Dont miss the congratulatory comments from the likes of Shakira, Maria Shriver, Arianna Huffington, Gavin Newsom and Katie Couric.


Seriously, the Zuckerberg-Chan letter is quite an evocative statement of what, in a different context, the writer Anand Giriharadas has called the Aspen Consensus (i.e. the winners of our age must be challenged to do more good, but never, ever tell them to do less harm.) We can advance human potential and promote equality and lift hundreds of millions out of poverty through scientific advances against disease, personalized learning, and more internet access, Zuckerberg and Chan write their daughter. Theres no mention anywhere of systemic forces that destroy human potential, ravage communities, or increase inequality. Nor do they contemplate the possibility that much stronger medicine (taxes? regulations?) might be needed to promote equality than just improving education.


Responding to Zuckerberg and Chans announcement, Nathan Schneider, co-organizer of the recent Platform Cooperatives conference, tweeted: What if, instead of picking pet charities, Zuckerberg returned his shares to the users who made Facebook feel like a commons?...The wealth Zuckerberg wants to give away is the wealth of our relationships, our wisdom, our milestones, our communities.


Related: On Quora, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton answers a question about how being a grandmother would make her a better president.

More than anything, I want to make sure she grows up in a country that is peaceful and prosperousone that gives everyone an opportunity to live up to his or her potential.

What sharing economy? Hubert Horan, one of the architects of trucking deregulation in the 1970s, has written (in the form of a letter to Pando Daily) a long and absolutely fascinating critique of Uber and other unicorn companies with a similar business model, like Convoy, which is trying to be the Uber of trucking. The tl/dr version: Unlike Amazon and Ebay, Uber and Convoy are not transforming the consumer product they provide, nor is there much evidence of bloat and waste in the industries theyve entered. Instead, their raw political power and ruthless marketplace behavior is all they actually have. Heres the key paragraph:
Extreme wealth accumulation and corporate power has been historically tolerated because of the perception that the Bezos and Omidyars of the world (like the Carnegies and Rockefellers of the past) created huge public welfare improvements en route to their wealth and power and the (more problematic) perception that the size and power of this class will be constrained by economic reality at the end of the day. Uber-type unicorns are purely exploitativethey create fabulous wealth for a handful, while destroying economic value in aggregate (assets have been shifted from more efficient firms to a less efficient firm, artificial market power is used to exploit drivers, suppliers and consumers, etc.). Wealth accumulators whod built companies on legitimate economic strengths needed political power defensivelyto protect their pot of gold, and to slow down the market forces that would inevitably erode those strengths. Uber-type investors need much more political power, and they need to use it as an offensive weapon immediately on start-up. If the unicorn investing class thinks Uber has proven that tens of billions of private value can be created purely with PR and political strength, then Unicorn manufacturing becomes an industry unto itself. Lots of investors will attempt to replicate the formula time and time again, and each new unicorn creates the need to increase raw political power used to enrich these investors, and to destroy any possible political opposition.


Trump watch: Channeling Marshall McLuhan, media theorist Douglas Rushkoff argues that Donald Trump is the ultimate internet candidate, not in how he is using the network to organize his supporters, but in how digigenic his performance is. He writes:
Theres no great network of Trump Meetups or series of Reddit exchanges. Yet Trump is an internet spectacle nonethelessa political Charlie Sheen who seems to know exactly how to ride the crest of trending topics, or even create them. On television, his speeches are incoherent mashups, without a clear story or theme. As clickbait, though, they are perfect: short, angry slogans, each more explosive than the last. With Sheen it was tiger blood and winning; with Trump, its Jersey City Jihadists and also, possibly, winning.


FWD.us, the pro-immigration group backed by Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and other tech moguls, is planning to spend as much as $10 million over the next year to tilt the political system toward reform in 2017, Blake Hounshell reports for Politico. A Global Strategy Group survey of likely voters in CO, FL and NV found that people prefer a candidate who supports a pathway to citizenship over mass deportation by 74 to 18 percent.


Is this civic tech? Shelly Culp attended the recent Code for America Summit and sat with some attendees during lunch who were extremely happy to talk to complete strangers about what apps theyre working on and from that she determined, as she writes in an oped for TechWire, that civic techies dont appreciate the environments in which decision-makers work and what arcane rules govern them. Umm, really?


With the help of BetaNYC, the New York City Council just launched Labs.Council.NYC, an alpha version of a new council website aimed at informing a wider city audience and engaging it in decision-making processes.


Airbnb has started sharing tons of data on its New York City user base, including stats on host earnings, types of listings and how often people are renting out their homes, the New York Times Mike Isaac reports. 99 percent of people on Airbnb in New York City are using it as an economic lifeline, Chris Lehane, its head of global policy and public affairs, told Isaac.

This is civic tech: And its a big deal, too. Months of concerted effort catalyzed by Code for America has resulted in Californias Department of Social Services revamping its IT procurement process to allow a more agile and iterative approach to building the states new Child Welfare System. Dan Hon, CFAs content director, explains the whole story in detail.


Microsoft Civics Matt Stempeck (a denizen of Civic Hall) has started a new Tumblr tracking the Civic Features of mainstream apps. Examples include Facebook letting users know when their account may be targeted by state-sponsored actors, Google responding to searches related to being pimped with information about the National Human Trafficking Resource Center, and Bing pushing book searchers to public libraries. (This builds on the we need apps to be more civic, not more civic apps theory of Nick Grossman.)


Heres Mark Headd of Accela building on Tom Steinbergs musings on tech that changes power relations, arguing that open data is an example of a technology whose power increases as it becomes more widely adopted.


Opening government: Advocates for greater transparency and accountability in government are celebrating yesterdays corruption conviction of New York states former assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, and there is a delicious irony buried in this story by Vivian Yee and Nate Schweber for the New York Times on the jury deliberations. Silvers defense attorneys had argued that nothing he didincluding steering $500K in state money to a longtime crony, who then referred some of his patients with potentially profitable legal claims to law firms that paid Silver millions in legal feeswas illegal, and that in fact this was just business as usual in Albany. (Yes, that was their defense.) The last juror to hold out on a guilty verdict wasnt convinced this pattern of transactions was scheming or manipulation until she noticed that the name of one of the law firms was hidden in Silvers legislative financial disclosure forms. I was wondering, why wouldnt it just be out in the open just like the other things, why was this kind of hidden, she recalled later. Within the hour, the jury had reached its unanimous verdict. Those of us with long memories recall that it was Silvers failure to be fully transparent on his annual disclosure forms that got federal investigators interested in him in the first place. The next time you hear someone say that increased transparency doesnt help with fighting corruption, ask them if they know how Silver was caught.


Nicholas Merrill, the first American to fight and defeat a National Security Letter issued to him by the FBI, has now won the right to discuss the details of that order openly, Kevin Gosztola reports for Shadowproof.


Trump watch: Former Harvard Kennedy School professor and ex-Los Angeles Times deputy publisher Nicco Mele (who is still very much a PDM friend) gives his 7 reasons why Trump will win Iowa and New Hampshire. Its a pretty solid summary, combining everything from the Perot precedent to the ways new media have elevated the politics of the moment, to the value of making politics seem fun (to alienated white people).


Prompted by a tweet from Revolution Messagings Michael Whitney (who is working on the Bernie Sanders president campaign) digging political platform vendor NationBuilder because Donald Trumps campaign is using it, NationBuilder CEO Jim Gilliam responds: I thought the freedom to assemble + petition government (the 1st Amendment) was a progressive value. (In case you doubt the NationBuilder-Trump connection, this tweet from a Trump staffer makes it explicit.)


Weather patterns: Yale sociology professor Justin Farrell handcoded information on 4,556 individuals from 164 organizations identified as climate change contrarians and their funding sources, and found that those who received funding from ExxonMobil or the Koch family network were more successful at getting their viewpoints into mainstream media, Bloomberg Business Eric Roston reports.


Whither the open internet: University of Kentucky law professor Andrew Keane Woods warns, in this New York Times oped, against the growing balkanization of the global internet as more countries chafe against limits that American law puts on their requests for data on crime suspects that may sit on American servers.

Todays civic tech must-read: Former mySociety director Tom Steinberg calls on technologists to focus on building tools that permanently shift power. He argues that the power-shifting effects of fundraising apps and targeted political ads have been temporary (the other side catches up), whereas mobile computing is a power shifting technology that permanently empowers the security services.


Parija Kavalanz reports for CNN Money on how Hive, a NY-based start-up funded by the United Nations Refugee Agency, is using predictive data modeling to find the Americans most likely to support refugees. Were working with the same data team that was behind President Obamas 2008 campaign, Hives director Brian Reich says.


ICitizen is a Nashville, Tennessee-based civic start-up that is working to build a community platform where constituents and government officials collaborate, Jamie McGee reports for The Tennessean. Launched in 2013, it claims 150,000 users and a staff of 57 employees currently working to enhance the app. The company has raised nearly $13 million in outside capital.


Brave new world: The Los Angeles city council wants to to access a database of license plates captured in certain places around the city, translate these license plates to obtain the name and address of each owner, and send to that owner a letter explaining that the vehicle was seen in, an area known for prostitution. As Nick Selby, the CEO of StreetCred Software, writes in Medium, there are grave issues of freedom of transportation and freedom of association here.


Related: Police in Chicago have begun delivering custom notifications to people that its predictive policing model says are at high risk of becoming a party to violence in the near future, Susan Crawford reports for Mediums Backchannel. The letter comes with a personal knock on the door, offers of social services and a warning of the enhanced penalties a subject may received if arrested again for a violent crime. Crawford writes that this data-driven initiative seeks to use cops as guardians rather than warriors, building public trust and legitimacy through pro-active interventions, but with the Chicago police union currently standing firm behind the cop who shot Laquan McDonald its hard to see why anyone should trust that these predictive models arent biased at their base.


The Indian radical writer Arundhati Roy describes what it was like for her, American actor John Cusack, and Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg to meet NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in Moscow. Two observations from her worth pondering: the first is how both Ellsberg and Snowden were, originally, totally devoted to patriotic missions (for Ellsberg, to save his country from communism, and for Snowden, to save it from Islamic terrorism). And second, how the debate over Snowden and the NSA leaves out other countries, other cultures, other conversations.


Trump watch: Heres the most worrisome aspect of Molly Balls on-the-scene report for The Atlantic of Republican frontrunner Donald Trumps recent mass rally in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: Despite all the negativity and fear, the energy in this room does not feel dark and aggressive and threatening. It doesnt feel like a powder keg about to blow, a lynch mob about to rampage. It feels joyous.


Journalist Dave Neiwert explains why Trump is an extraordinarily dangerous right-wing populist demagogue, and not a genuine, in-the-flesh fascist.


Rob Ford in Canada was there before Trump, writes NYU press critic Jay Rosen. Which is to say, the old assumption that blatant lies, gaffes, and misbehavior would bring down a politician, now in tatters around the Trump phenomenon, was never that solid.


Third party matters: The national Working Families Party has announced that it is holding an online endorsement vote of its members and affiliates to decide who it should back for president in the Democratic presidential primary. The WFP has affiliates in ten states, including NY, MD, NJ, CT, OR, PA and DC, plus four national partners (SEIU, MoveOn.org, CWA and Center for Popular Democracy). Each state affiliate will have two votes, to be determined by their state leadership, as will each national partner. The national membership vote will count for four votes.

Brave new world: Sasha Issenberg reports for Bloomberg Politics on the work of data-mining start-up Applecart, which has built a social graph of the voters of New Hampshire in an attempt to figure out not just who is connected to who socially, but who has the greatest influence on who. The companys data comes from library visits nationwide (to cull yearbooks, church lists, sports rosters and the like) to the scraping of websites that contain things like law-firm directories. Issenberg writes:
On Applecarts social graph of New Hampshire, each voter is treated as a node in a network with each of their known contacts webbed around them. (Around a dozen voters in the state were found to be hermits, with no meaningful interpersonal links.) Nuclear family, extended family, friends, professional acquaintances, and non-professional acquaintances are each assigned different statistical weights, then mixed with other values such as geographical proximity to calibrate a connection score between the voters in question.
The company is working on behalf of John Kasichs presidential Super PAC. Applecart has also built a social network analysis of large donors to moderate Republican presidential candidates in the past, giving Kasich fundraisers a list of targets to woo.

This is civic tech: Journalist and Oscar winner Laura Poitras explains why she is supporting the Tor Project. Edward Snowden would not have been able to contact me without Tor and other free software encryption projects. Journalists need Tor to protect their sources and to research freely. It is an essential tool, and it needs our support.


Writing for TechCrunch, Accela CEO Maury Blackman argues that 2016 will be a year of leaps forward in the civic technology industry. Among the trends he identifies: governments will expand their efforts to update their IT services, agencies will be more entrepreneurial about engaging the public, governments will embrace the Internet of Things and invest heavily in embedding smart sensors in their physical infrastructure, and public agencies will start embracing sharing economy start-ups like MuniRent, which lets municipalities rent equipment to each other.


Brewster Kahle of the Internet Archive wanted to start a credit union aimed at helping the poor and workers at nonprofits obtain loans, but as this story by Nathaniel Popper details for the New York Times, he and his colleagues have abandoned the effort because federal agency charged with regulating credit unions completely stymied their efforts.

Todays civic-tech must-read: Joshua Tauberer, a 15-year veteran of open government platform-making (he runs GovTrack.us), has posted a well-reasoned rant explaining why people trying to fix democracy with new tech tools or platforms are almost universally going to fail. IMHO, Tauberer is a bit too harsh, but he is right to argue that most people approach this arena with little sense of how hard or expensive it is to make a dent in the problem


Related: Longtime press critic Michael Massing takes note of recent efforts by the New York Times to cover the one percent, like a front-page story focused on the 158 families that have given nearly half the money raised by presidential candidates, but argues that more such attention is needed. He writes:
In American journalism as a whole, the coverage of the superrich is far too sporadic, fleeting, and unimaginative to make a real difference. News organizations need to develop a new methodology that can allow them to document the structure of wealth, power, and influence in Americato show how the ultrarich make their money, what they do with it, and to what effect. The coverage needs to be more sustained, ambitious, and broadly conceived. And digital technology can help.


Massing points to some exemplars (without hyperlinks in the original, thoughwhats up with that, New York Review of Books editors?): Muckety, along with three other eye-on-the-elite groups, LittleSis, SourceWatch, and RightWeb, are all useful, but they are underfunded, overmatched, and (at times) ideologically oriented. A new site with an experienced staff of reporters, editors, and digital whizzes could burrow deep into the world of the one percent and document the remarkable impact they are having on so many areas of American life. As information on them is gathered, it could be incorporated into a database that could become the go-to site for information about the nations elite and their power. Of course, such a site would cost a bit of money to create. Where might such money be found?


This is civic tech: Our Jessica McKenzie reports on the launch of NYC Councilmatic, an open government platform built by (Civic Hall member) David Moore of the Participatory Politics Foundation that stands on the shoulders of earlier versions built by civic hackers in Philadelphia and Chicago.


Making All Voices Count has announced 50 semi-finalists for its global call for innovative approaches to governance issues. Were seeing more local-level use of technology, from radio programmes connecting women to their members of parliament on a regular basis, to parents sending SMSs to a public dashboard that tracks whether teachers turn up at their local school, the group notes.


Keep calm and carry on: Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com says its too early to take Donald Trumps front-runner status seriously, because most people arent paying all that much attention to the campaign right now. According to his analysis of Google search data from 2008 and 2012, interest in the primaries doesnt really start to peak until a week or two before Iowas caucuses.


Brave new world: ShotSpotter, an expensive technology that uses net-connected microphones to pinpoint the location of gunshots in urban environments, could help authorities know, as quickly as possible, when a possible terrorist attack is happening, Christopher Mims writes for the Wall Street Journal. The company has recently announced a deal with General Electric that would piggyback on its new smart LED lights that are laden with motion, sound and video sensors. Ahh, the seductions of always-on ambient surveillance...


An FAA task force studying drone policy has recommended that registration of pilots be mandatory for anyone flying a unmanned aircraft weighing more than half a pound, Joshua Goldman reports for CNET.

Governing attitudes: The Pew Research Center is out with a new report on Americans attitudes toward government. While many of the findings are familiaronly one in five trust the government always or most of the timesome are startling.


27 percent of registered voters say they think of the federal government as an enemy vs. 36 percent who see it as a friend, with 35 percent of Republicans, 34 percent of independents, and 12 percent of Democrats describing it as an enemy.


The top rated government agencies are the U.S. Postal Service, the National Park Service, and the Centers for Disease Control. (Veterans Affairs and the IRS are the lowest rated.)


A 55 percent majority say that ordinary Americans would do a better job of solving the countrys problems than their elected representatives. (Bring back Athenian democracy and pick our reps by lottery!)


Asked to name the biggest problem with elected officials in Washington, Democrats and Republicans alike put the influence of special interest money at the top of their list. Three-quarters overall say there should be limits on campaign spending.


One-quarter of the public has an unfavorable view of both major parties, up from 12 percent in 2008.




The Economist reviews the results of the open data revolution and asks why more has not been achieved. The answers it offers: First, the data that have been made available are often useless. Second, the data engineers and entrepreneurs who might be able to turn it all into useful, profitable products find it hard to navigate. Third, too few people are capable of mining data for insights or putting the results to good use. Finally, it has been hard to overcome anxieties about privacy.


Internet companies have tripled their spending on lobbying in Washington, D.C. in the last five years, and while much of that comes from giants Google and Facebook, new companies reliant on freelance workers in the on-demand economy are accounting for a rising chunk, reports Cecilia Kang for the New York Times.


Scaremongering: Keep an eye on Trump Card LLC, a guerilla campaign aimed at destroying Donald Trumps presidential candidacy, being launched by Liz Mair, former online communications director for the Republican National Committee (and a friend of PDM), as reported by Beth Reinhard and Janet Hook for the Wall Street Journal.


Asked about the initiative on ABCs This Week show, Trump said that if the Republican establishment knocked him out of the race by not treating him fairly he would be open to running as an independent, Laura Meckler reports for the Wall Street Journal. He also declared his support for bringing back waterboarding, and doubled down on his claim that thousands of Arab-Americans living in New Jersey celebrated when the World Trade Center towers fell in 2001.


Keep calm and tweet a cat: When Belgian authorities asked social media users to stop sharing details of the anti-terror lockdown underway there in the wake of the Paris attacks, people responded by flooding the #Bruxelles and #BrusselsLockdown hashtags with cute cat memes aimed at relieving the stress of the moment and mocking ISIS, Alia Dastagir reports for USA Today.


This suggests that Ethan Zuckermans cute cat theory of digital activism needs amending. If you recall, he argues that its good that activists rely on popular public platforms that most people use for sharing mundane media like cute cat photos because their very popularity makes it harder for governments to shut those platforms down. Here the government effectively shut down a popular news channel, but since that action was widely supported, people responded by sharing more cute cat photos. Ipso facto, the more something attracts cat memes, the more popular it is. Or, perhaps more simply: the opposite of terror is a cute cat.


In Sundays New York Times, technosociologist Zeynep Tufecki offers a sober explanation why weakening encrypted communications tools like WhatsApp wont stop terrorists.


This is civic tech: Seamus Kraft of the OpenGov Foundation posts an update on the work they are doing with the Chicago City Council to modernize its legislative systems. He writes: Together, were overhauling the internal policy-making process to include Google Docs-style collaboration with a commitment to open data formats. Citizens will be able to stay on top of (and be heard in) city council business through a user-friendly system. Were creating a scalable software suite to support more efficient, effective and accountable legislative operations with fewer paper-based headaches and hassles. Success is a flexible open source operating system built with the Chicago City Council that is fully adaptable to the unique realities and culture of any city, state and county legislative body.


She should run: Civic Hall member organization VoteRunLead is in the middle of a big push to recruit more women to run for elected office, and having hit their current goal of 500 women nominated nationwide, theyre shooting to double that. Pitch in and nominate someone!

Editorial comment: While the focus of Civicist and this First Post morning round-up is on civic techthe use of technology for public goodwe believe it is also important to pay attention to larger trends as well. Civic tech cannot be neutral. It is for improving the lives of the many, not just the few. It is for expanding and improving democracy, not for narrowing or reducing it. It is for comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. It is for creating a more just and equitable society.


It is not civic to try to close state borders to innocent and desperate refugees fleeing a genocidal dictator. It is not civic to single out people of one religion for special state surveillance and control. To be sure, racist and xenophobic attitudes in America didnt appear out of nowhere a week ago, and many good people have been battling these trends for a very long time. But since the Paris terror attacks, American politics has taken a decidedly darker and meaner turn. The civic tech community should not be silent in the face of these developments. Bad things happen when good people fail to speak up. So, please dear readers, do not click away when we talk about these issues. Join in.


Ill tidings: Thursday night, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump said he would certainly implement a database system tracking American Muslims, including signing them up at mosques and giving them a special form of identification. Asked by NBC News Vaughn Hillyard if there was a difference between requiring Muslims to register and requiring Jews to do so in Nazi Germany, he said, You tell me.


As Philip Bump reports for the Washington Post, Trump asserted that he was opposed to a federal registry for gun owners but refused to explain why a database of gun sales would be an invasion of privacy and subject to abuse, while those risks dont concern him with an index of Muslim Americans and migrants.


Not to be out-Trumped, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson compared Syrian refugees seeking to enter the United States to rabid dogs, Carrie Dan reports for NBC News. He added, We have to have in place screening mechanisms that allow us to determine who the mad dogs are, quite frankly.


Also Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 289-137 to stop allowing Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the United States until top national security officials certify that they dont pose security risks. When CNN Politics reporter Elisa Labott tweeted that news, adding Statue of Liberty bows head in anguish, she was suspended for two weeks. Eight hours later, she tweeted, Everyone, It was wrong of me to editorialize. My tweet was inappropriate and disrespectful. I sincerely apologize.


Many public figures responded on Twitter to Labotts apology, telling her that she was right to speak up and wrong to apologize, including Twitter investor Chris Sacca, Egyptian democracy activist Wael Ghonim, Daily Beast executive editor Noah Schachtman, Atlantic senior writer James Fallows, documentarian Alex Gibney and Reported.lys Andy Carvin.


The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum issued a highly unusual public statement on Syrian refugees, which read in part: Acutely aware of the consequences to Jews who were unable to flee Nazism, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum looks with concern upon the current refugee crisis. While recognizing that security concerns must be fully addressed, we should not turn our backs on the thousands of legitimate refugees. The Museum calls on public figures and citizens to avoid condemning todays refugees as a group. It is important to remember that many are fleeing because they have been targeted by the Assad regime and ISIS for persecution and in some cases elimination on the basis of their identity.


On the compassionate crowdfunding site YouCaring, people are raising money to personally help resettle Syrian refugees.


More crypto-wars: Ex-CIA director James Woolsey says NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has the blood of Paris on his hands and that he should be convicted of treason and hanged by the neck until hes dead, Bradford Richardson reports for The Hill.


GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul told a crowd of undergraduates at George Washington University that, When they stand up on television and say, the tragedy in Paris means you have to give up your liberty, we need more phone surveillancebullshit! as David Weigel and Jose DelReal report for the Washington Post.


Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also tells the Post, Frankly I think the speed with which surveillance hawks leapt ahead of the factsblaming everything from Snowden to encryption to surveillance reforms that havent even taken effect yetis likely to backfire. Its so clearly reflexive and not grounded in any kind of concrete evidence about this specific case. Playing on peoples fears to shut down debate was a pretty effective strategy for many years after 9/11, but I think we saw in the debate over the USA Freedom Act that its lost a lot of its effectiveness.


Tech bubbles: Yesterday, on his Facebook page, tech investor and founder of Code.org Hadi Partovi asked Mark Zuckerberg if the newsfeed algorithm can help decrease Americas political divide. He wrote:
My feed shows only pro-immigrant posts, boosted by Likes from my pro-immigrant friends. Im certain there are anti-immigrants on Facebook, and in their network they may see a unanimous chorus in the opposite direction. Perhaps the algorithm amplifies a divide, and can it somehow make our world slightly more connected? With dialogue we can build bridges not walls, but not if we dont even see posts from those whose viewpoints differ.


An hour later, Zuckerberg replied, arguing that Newsfeed actually shows much *more* diverse opinions than youd typically see on any other media, and citing a 2012 research paper by Facebook data scientist Eytan Bakshy that argued that users in 2010 were getting the vast majority of information..from contacts that they interact with infrequently. Its kind of crazy that Zuckerberg is relying on five-year-old data to argue that Newsfeed doesnt form echo chambersespecially when you consider that Facebook has made several major changes in the Newsfeed algorithm since 2010 (adding more hard news to it, for example).


Pressed by another Silicon Valley VC, Sherwin Pishevar, to consider if there might be creative ways for the feed/algorithm to present opposing views from friends, friends and friends and even strangers, Zuckerberg admitted Theres always more to do and we always think about this in our work. But then he dug in his heels, writing, My point was only that the narrative that social media is dividing us based on our own viewpoints is incorrect. It turns out social media is much better for exposing us to diverse viewpoints than anything weve had to date. If you say so, boss.


Talking with TechCrunchs Andrew Keen, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom says American politics needs systemic change, of the kind that Silicon Valley specializes in. Youll have to watch the video to truly appreciate Newsoms facility with Valley buzzwords.


This is civic tech: New on Civicist: Just in time for the release of the final episode of The Hunger Games, Katie Bowers of the Harry Potter Alliance explains how to use pop culture to increase civic engagement.


Good Jobs First has launched Violation Tracker, a database of corporate misconduct that contains 100,000 cases involving government penalties of $5,000 or more issued by the EPA, OSHA, and 11 other government agencies. You can use it to find out which corporations are big violators of environmental, health and safety laws in the United States. Banking, antitrust and wage violations are to be added later.


Stefan Baack has updated his network map of Githubs global civic tech community, noting that it is an inaccurate proxy for that entire community: Individuals or groups who are not using GitHubs social features (such as following or starring) are underrepresented in this data. Moreover, when we talk about civic tech on a global scale we are not only talking about developers. Naturally, activist groups are not using GitHub as much so they are underrepresented as well. Nonetheless, his visualization of the contributor network to GitHub repos is spectacular.


Coming up Thursday, December 3 here in NYC: When Free Speech and Democracy Conflict: Campaign Finance in the Age of Citizens United, a talk by Jonathan Soros, who is a Senior Fellow with the Roosevelt Institute. RSVP here.

The headline from Politicos Mike Allen blares Kochs use high tech to track left, but the details of Kenneth Vogels new report on the right-wing billionaires intelligence gathering operation are more prosaic.

The crypto wars are back...and with a vengeance in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris. As David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth report for the New York Times, national security and law enforcement officials are renewing their criticism of tech companies that provide end-to-end encryption of their users communications, even though American and French officials say there is still no definitive evidence to back up their presumption that the terrorists who massacred 129 people in Paris used new, difficult-to-crack encryption technologies to organize the plot.


CIA director John Brennan denounced handwringing in the wake of Edward Snowdens disclosures, saying it has allowed terrorists to flourish, Alex Shepherd reports for the New Republic.


Jameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the ACLU, responds, As far as I know, theres no evidence the French lacked some kind of surveillance authority that would have made a difference. When weve invested new powers in the government in response to events like the Paris attacks, they have often been abused.


Also on Monday, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio criticized two of his rivals, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, for voting to weaken the U.S. intelligence program and leav[e] America vulnerable, Patrick OConnor reports for The Wall Street Journal.


Rethinking the sharing economy: Last Friday and Saturday, more than a thousand people attended the Platform Cooperativism conference at The New School. The event, which was organized by Trebor Scholz and Nathan Schneider (and grew out of an earlier panel event at Civic Hall this past spring), was filled with passionate debate about the prospects of organizing a different approach to the ownership and governance of the emerging on-demand economy, as Jay Cassano reports for Shareable.


Maybe Uber isnt that much of an economic juggernaut. Thats the argument of economist Lawrence Mishel, writing in The Atlantic, who points out that Uber drivers represent significantly less than 0.1 percent of all full-time-equivalent employment. He adds, Even using [Uber senior adviser David] Plouffes current count of 400,000 Uber drivers, all working 10 percent fewer hours than in 2014, then Uber could account for between 0.1 to 0.14 percent of total full-time-equivalent employment at the end of 2015.


This is civic tech: Mark Cridge, the new director of mySociety, has written an excellent statement on Why we do what we do. He writes:
What links all of our work is the creation of civic technology that enables greater access for citizens to the work of government and the democratic process: Lack of access to elected representatives amongst disadvantaged or underrepresented groups is a key driver of exclusion and inequality, yet governments tend only to become better at serving the needs of citizens when those citizens are capable of demanding better. Simply put, this is our cause.


This cant wait till the weekend: Adrian Chens long feature story for The New Yorker on how Megan Phelps-Roper, one of the daughters of the ultra-right Westboro Baptist Church, came to question her beliefs and ultimately leave the church thanks to friends and relationships that she developed from using Twitter is just mind-blowingly good.

Tech vs. terror: BuzzFeeds Brendan Klinkenberg reports on how several leading tech platforms, including Facebook, Google, Airbnb, Uber, and Twitter responded to the terror attacks in Paris. Facebook activated its safety check tool, helping 4.1 million people alert their friends and family that they were safe. Uber turned off surge pricing in Paris. Airbnb urged local hosts to make their homes available for free or low cost. Twitter users crowded around the hashtag #PorteOuverte to help Parisians find sanctuary. And Google made international calls to France free via Hangouts.


Facebook faced criticism for not having used safety check for other non-Western crises, and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg quickly responded that in the future, the giant social network will implement its safety check feature for more human disasters, as Alex Howard reports for the Huffington Post. While the option was activated in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, it had not been offered to users in the wake of suicide bombings in Beirut two days earlier.


Facebooks vice president of growth, Alex Schultz, also said the company will explore giving users options to show support for other things that they care about through their Facebook profiles, a reference to the companys enabling users to add the silhouette of Frances tricolor flag to their profiles. As Howard astutely notes, The criteria that will be used to determine which issues and events users will be able to show support for, however, arent clear. No option has been offered to users to show solidarity with the people of Lebanon or Syria, for example.


As you consider Facebooks emerging approach to human disasters, keep in mind that its CEO is still hungry to crack the one global market the company has yet to penetrate: China. He says, We care about all people equally, and we will work hard to help people suffering in as many of these situations as we can. We shall see.


How many gigs in the gig economy? Lydia dePillis takes a behind-the-scenes look for the Washington Post on how an unusual group of tech companies, labor advocates, and think-tankers came together to call for new benefits for people working in the gig economy.


One interesting angle dePillis notes: not all economists agree with the Freelancers Unions assessment that 53 million people are independent workers. Official numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest its more like 15 million. Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute says, Its not true, and I think its in service of making people think that things are changing much faster than they are, and that therefore the legal models that we have shouldnt be applied, says Eisenbrey. Thats Ubers wish, that they escape from employment obligations, that they not have to pay minimum wage and overtime. I think that something like this could be misused.


Debatable: For the first time in my memory, a live presidential debate included a real-time question from someone watching that was in response to something one of the candidates said. As Alexandra Petri points out for the Washington Post, the tweet came in response to Democratic candidate Hillary Clintons assertion that her millions in Wall Street connected donations were because of her hard work helping the financial sector rebuild after 9/11. Ive never seen a candidate invoke 9/11 to justify millions of Wall Street donations until now, wrote Andy Grewal, at 10:07pm the night of the debate. Moments later, his question was posed directly to Clinton. (Grewal, who says he admires Bernie Sanders but thinks his tax plan is too radical, has since jokingly offered to retract his tweet in exchange for 10% of [Hillarys] Wall Street donations.


Hidden deep in the Wi-Fi SSIDs and passwords for media attending the Republican and Democratic presidential debates, Upworthys Parker Molloy finds meaning.


This is civic tech: Omidyar Network investment partner Stacy Donohue writes for TechCrunch on three ways that techies can join the civic tech movement: by solving personal challenges (such as the ones that led some vets to start Unite US, or that led Rose Broome to start HandUp); by taking a career leap into government (like Megan Smith of Google or Alex Macgillivray of Twitter, both now at the White House); or by becoming more active citizens using problem-solving platforms like Citizinvestor or SeeClickFix.

Todays must-reads: New America president (and Civic Hall founding partner) Anne-Marie Slaughter and Open Technology Institute senior adviser Ben Scott say its time for think tanks to become civic enterprises. They explain:
Civic because it engages citizens as change makersconscious members of a self-governing polity that expects government to be at least part of the solution to problems that individuals cannot solve on their own. And enterprise because of the energy and innovation involved in actually making change on the ground. Civic enterprise blends conventional policy research with local organizing, coalition building, public education, advocacy, and bottom-up projects that generate and test ideas before, during, and after engagement in the policymaking process with government.


They add: The pendulum of American political history is swinging toward democratizing technocracy, giving people more opportunity to participate in self-government. This is particularly powerful in an era when many citizens doubt the power and value of their vote. Civic enterprise is about knocking down the walls and partitions that have grown up between the policy class and the citizens we purport to serve. Amen to that!


Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith has posted a long manifesto on technology and privacy, with the intriguing title of In the cloud we trust.  In it, he urinates on some of the biggest events of the last yearthe Charlie Hebdo attack, the Sony Pictures hack, as well as governments from Russia to China to the United Kingdom and the United States seeking greater access to and control of individual online communicationsand wrestles with the conflicting demands of cybersecurity and personal privacy and free expression. He concludes:
Inspired by the events of the past year, our cloud business will be grounded in four commitments to governments, enterprises, consumers, and people around the world. We will keep their data secure. We will ensure peoples data is private and under their control. We will figure out the laws in each country and make sure data is managed accordingly. And we will be transparent so people know what we are doing.

GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul says he has mixed feelings about Edward Snowden, agreeing that he is a whistleblower but also arguing that there probably has to be some penalty for his revealing classified government information.


Speed of Change: The #BlackOnCampus hashtag has exploded with people who are dissecting examples of white privilege, microaggression, and accusations of reverse racism, reports Katie Rogers for the New York Times. (Topsy analytics show nearly 100,000 uses of the hashtag in the last two days.)

Yahoo is holding a conference on tech and politics today at Drake University in Des Moines, starting at 9:30am Central Time, livestreamed here. Sen. Rand Paul is the one presidential candidate on the agenda.


Concurrent with that event, Yahoo has released the results of a major poll exploring Americans attitudes towards the impact of tech on politics. Among its findings:


While most Americans believe tech has made American politics more inclusive and representative of what people really think, African-American and Hispanics believe that more strongly (74 percent and 73 percent) than whites (60 percent).


A majority of whites (57 percent) think social media has made politics more negative, compared to just 41 percent of African-Americans.


Most Americans dont think tech has given them more of a voice, as an individual, in politics. Just 23 percent of Hispanics, 21 percent of African-Americans, 18 percent of whites and 15 percent of Asians believe it has.




Reporting from the Fast Company Innovation Festival here at Civic Hall this week, John Paul Titlow highlights three projects coming out of the U.S. Digital Service and 18F that are dramatically changing how government uses tech.


Related: Justin Herman, the SocialGov Lead for the GSA, sits down with GovTechs Jason Shueh to talk about how federal agencies are learning to improve their civic engagement strategies.


The Intercepts Jordan Smith and Micah Lee report that Securus Technologies, one of the leading providers of phone services to prisons nationwide, has been recording tens millions of calls, including thousands between inmates and their lawyers. A hacker was able to obtain access to more than 70 million call records, information that was then provided to the Intercept via its Secure Drop leaking platform.


This is civic tech: Weve been in love with Loveland Technologies co-founder Jerry Paffendorf ever since 2010 when he bought a vacant lot in Detroit and put 10,000 square inches of it up for sale for $1 apiece, and more recently when he and his team led the Motor City Mapping project that gave the city its first up-to-date map of every tax property. Now, as Bill Bradley reports for Next City in a long profile, Loveland is branching out beyond its home city to work on opening up land survey information across the U.S., and Paffendort is also one of eight candidates seeking to replace the retiring Wayne County Treasurer, who oversees tax foreclosure auctions.

Tech and the presidentials: Tech policy hasnt really surfaced yet as an issue in the presidential campaign, but during last nights Republican debate, rising contender Marco Rubio did say this: It took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took Candy Crush one year to reach 100 million users. [Laughter.] So the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive. Rubio, who opposes net neutrality, wasnt asked how he thought the next Candy Crush would grow that rapidly if we lose the open internet.


Rival Floridian Jeb Bush had this to say about that issue, kind of: On the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them. And start over. For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.


As a co-sponsor of last nights debate, Facebook got mentioned ten times, either as a source of an anodyne question from a random user or as the source of some vague data about obvious issues Americans are talking about. Each time, though, Facebook got mentioned, making the evening a successful night for product placement.


Internet startup founders represent an entirely distinct, libertarian-like ideology within the Democratic party, writes Gregory Ferenstein in The Guardian. Tech startup founders see the government as an investor in citizens, rather than as a protector from capitalism.


This is civic tech: Writing for Civicist, Ruth Miller draws on her experience facilitating part of the Refugee Hackathon in Berlin to urge that more attention be paid to the impact of media attention on the vulnerable populations civic hackers may be trying to help.


Writing for Quartz, Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry riffs on Nick Grossman and Elizabeth Woykes new (and free to download) e-book, Serving Workers in the Gig Economy, and suggests that new platforms that help gig workers band together dont go far enough. Instead, he argues for a return to a pre-New Deal solution to the insecurities of work: forming mutual aid societies such as the Independent Order of Oddfellows or the United Order of True Reformer. Members paid dues in exchange for access to a wide range of services, based on the principle of reciprocity: todays donor might be tomorrows recipient.

Why cant we be friends? President Obama just launched his own Facebook page, because, apparently, the Barack Obama Facebook page isnt his, it just belongs to a politician with the same name and 45 million followers.


Tech and the campaign: Data from Facebook about interest in the GOP presidential candidates shows, more or less, what someone not looking at Facebook but paying attention to the conventional wisdom about the race might surmise, as Natalie Andrews, Dante Chinni and Brian McGill report for the Wall Street Journal: Donald Trumps dominating position is weakening somewhat; Ben Carson is a steady second; Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio got a bump in interest after the last Republican debate; and Jeb Bush is struggling to catch on.


Paging 18F: The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has spent more than ten years and over a billion dollars trying to switch over to a digital system for managing immigration applications and records, and so far has just one online form to show for it, Jerry Markon reports for the Washington Post.


New on Civicist: Jessica McKenzie reports on the growth of GovDelivery, which just passed the 100 million users mark, with an in-depth exclusive interview with CEO Scott Burns.

The signers include Brad Burnham of Union Square Ventures; Chad Dickerson, the CEO of Etsy; Marina Gorbis and Natalie Foster of the Institute for the Future; Logan Green and John Zimmer, the co-founders of Lyft; Nick Hanauer of Second Avenue Partners; Sara Horowitz, the founder of the Freelancers Union; Michelle Miller, co-founder or Coworker.org; Tim OReilly, founder of OReilly Media; Carmen Rojas, CEO of The Workers Lab; Anne-Marie Slaughter, President of New America; and Andy Stern, the President Emeritus of the SEIU.


Todays whither democracy must-read: Pollsters rose to prominence by claiming that measuring public opinion is good for democracy. But what if its bad? Thats the core question running through historian Jill Lepores trenchant report for the New Yorker on the rise of the polling industry. Polls dont take the pulse of democracy, she writes, they raise it. Youll want to read Lepores essay for nuggets like this one: In 1977, the R.N.C. acquired a mainframe computer, while the D.N.C. got its own mainframe in the eighties....Democratic technological advances awaited the personal computer; the R.N.C. is to I.B.M. as the D.N.C. is to Apple.

First, the bad news: While home-renting home-sharing start-up Airbnb has taken steps to protect hosts from unruly guests, its done little to protect guests from unsafe hosts beyond inviting them to down-rate them after a bad experience. Writing for Mediums Matter section, Zak Stone tells the harrowing story of his fathers untimely death trying out a tree swing at an Airbnb rental (the tree was rotten to the core and fell on him), pointing out that the company disclaims all liability and does nothing to insure that its hosts properties are safe, unlike traditional B&B services. Stone makes a damning indictment, pointing out that the company has been willing to spend money on improving what their hosts do when it fits its business model. He notes that it figured out early on that ugly photos of its listing in New York City were keeping guests away, so it invested in hiring professional photographers to document properties for free. He writes:
Of course, were Airbnb to invest in safety requirements by offering home inspections or by analyzing photo content to target higher-risk properties and features (pools, saunas, trampolines, etc.) with site-specific safety recommendations, such a program could be far more costly, and might jeopardize Airbnbs covetable neutrality as a platform. The irony is that amateur innkeepers who couldnt be trusted with the banal task of photographing and marketing their properties are expected to excel at hospitalitys most important rule: keeping guests safe and alive. The result: Airbnb is willing to send someone to make sure your trees look beautiful in their photos, but wont deal with whether or not those trees will fall on your head.


While predatory payday lenders have been pushed into the shadows by statewide crackdowns, Jack Smith IV of Mic.com reports on a new study from the civil rights data consulting firm Upturn that how they hide on the other end of Google searches, waiting for terms like need help paying rent to offer their services. He notes that Facebook bans all payday loan ads, while Googles approach is more porous.


A new joint report from the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity finds that secrecy, corruption, and conflicts of interest pervade state governments in America.

The New York Times rolled out its virtual reality journalism initiative Sunday, delivering free Google Cardboard viewers to its paper subscribers and publishing a multimedia report on child refugees around the world. The effort is very impressive, but am I the only person who wishes they called it immersive reality? (This aint Second Life, after all.)


President Obamas digital team, led by Jason Goldman and Kori Schulman, is hard at work building a personal online identity for the president, Julie Hirschfeld Davis reports for the New York Times.


This is civic tech: Civic Hall member Joel Natividad and his company Ontodia has announced the launch of its Civic Dashboards product, which includes a data portal, performance management tools, analytics-as-a-service with built-in templates for tools like crime maps, economic activity tracking and open source civic-tech projects.


Accelas Mark Headd offers some deep thoughts on the development of government as a platform ten years after Tim OReilly first popularized the concept, and argues that rather than expecting governments to plan, develop and maintain big, expensive APIs, we should focus instead on building microservices.


The new director of the Sunlight Foundations Sunlight Labs is Kat Duffy, who was previously at the State Departments Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor where she designed and oversaw a grant portfolio that emphasized data visualization, tool development for independent media organizations, customized application adaptation and end-user assessments, software localization, and support for internet freedom and open data advocacy initiatives, the foundation announced Friday.

Becky Hogge looked at six case studies of open government data usage in the U.K. for the Omidyar Network, and found that Private actors have taken government data, and they have transformed it in ways that are useful and valuable to citizens and consumers.

Warning shot: Proposition F, the controversial San Francisco ballot measure that would have curbed short-term home rentals, lost with 45 percent of the vote Tuesday, as did a proposed 18-month moratorium on new market-rate development in the Mission neighborhood, Emily Badger reports for the Washington Post. But as she notes, the issue of housing affordability in San Francisco isnt about to go away.
    

Airbnbs Chris Lehane, who spearheaded the companys massive lobbying effort against Prop F, lauded the vote on the companys policy blog as A victory for the middle class. The longtime Democratic political operatives language notably refers repeatedly to middle class families right to share their home and the home sharing community, though as best as I can tell very few hosts on Airbnb actually share their homes with anyone, according to the words old-fashioned dictionary definition. George Orwell would be proud of Lehane.


As Conor Dougherty and Mike Isaac report for the New York Times, companies like Airbnb and Uber are fighting local regulators by turning their users into a vast political operation that can be mobilized at any sign of a threat. With that in mind, they describe Lehanes Prop F victory press conference in San Francisco as a warning shot to other cities thinking about proposing new regulations.


Indeed, its hard not to read Lehanes blog post without thinking of Airbnb as a political campaignone that is steeped in the data-driven field organizing techniques honed by the Obama campaigns. He writes: This election was a victory for the middle class and it was made possible by the 138,000 members of the Airbnb community who had individual conversations with over 105,000 voters, knocked on 285,000 doors, including 55,000 today, and worked to generate support from more than 2,000 small, family-owned businesses in the city. This effort shows that home sharing is both a community and a movement.


While were on the topic of Orwellian language (aka Spinglish), David Plouffe, President Obamas former campaign manager and now the chief adviser and board member of Uber, recently shared this post on Ubers Under the Hood policy blog, titled Racing to rideshare. It too makes no mention of anyone charging anyone else for anything and brags repeatedly about Uber as a ridesharing service.


Campaign tech: Matt Lira, the former deputy executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (and a friend of PDM), says the reason why Republicans are getting beat by Democrats in the small-donor fundraising game isnt something technological, like the lack of unifying one-click donation platform like ActBlue: This is a cultural challenge. The largest Republican campaigns and organizations simply are not synced up on this issue; greater cooperation in this area would have an outsized influence on the problem.


User rights: Responding to Mondays release of the Ranking Digital Rights report, Yahoos Business and Human Rights Program has blogged that it is actively studying the results of the Index and will be discussing the findings with our teams. We are also looking forward to the important conversations that RDRs Index will spark about company disclosures and policies affecting users free expression and privacy.


Its not an explicit response to the report, but yesterday Twitter announced a new policy hub where the company plans to centralize information about the companys political efforts as well as policy issues affecting its users. We heart that.


Culture wars:The long-running reality TV show Mythbusters just announced that next years season will be its last, and on the New York Times oped page, James Meigs, the former editor of Popular Mechanics, pens a lovely piece praising it for having taught a whole generation how science works and why it matters.


Deep, deep lobbying: If you wonder where so much bad thinking about cyber-security policy comes from, set aside time to read William Arkin and Alexa OBriens detailed report for Vice News on The Most Militarized Universities in America. The rankings are based on a dataset of more than 90,000 individuals who have worked in the intelligence community since 9/11, which is just six percent of all the people in the US with a Top Secret clearance, and they document a vast expansion in national security academic funding. They write:
The gloomy result is that the academy (and by extension the philanthropic world) has failed to establish a post-9/11 academic program to cultivate the next generation of scholars who can offer a genuinely civilian counter-narrative to the national security state similar to the civilian arms control community created during the Cold War. Even at the most elite schools that rank in the top 100, the many centers and research institutes focusing on warfare and terrorism are predominantly adjuncts of the national security state


Eric Raymond, the author of the influential open-source bible The Cathedral and the Bazaar, has turned to the bizarre world of manospheric derangement, Jesse Singal writes for New York magazine. How so? By elevating a totally unsourced allegation that women-in-tech feminists have been trying to entrap men using honey pots and then accusing them of attempted assault, and that their chief target is the founder of Linux, Linus Torvalds. Singals eloquent take-down is worth reading not just for its depressing content but also for its style: The peristaltic movement of the misogynist web finally nudged the story to its inevitable destination... Now that is writing, my friends.

Debates 2.0: Welcome aboard Christine Cupaiuolo, our new Civic Engagement Fellow, who will be leading our Rethinking Debates project. Shell be reporting on how political debates around the world are using innovative formats and social media, focusing on examples that help make these crucial public events more informative, engaging, and responsive to the concerns of voters. Heres her first post.


This is civic tech: Writing for Mediums Backchannel, Susan Crawford reports on a pioneering open data project in Louisville, Kentucky, where the citys commitment to make all municipal public information open by default combined with a local business focused on serving the blind and the local Civic Data Alliance produced a drastically improved version of Open Street Map that can now support many new third-party apps and services.


Columbus, Ohio, is the home of the worlds first B-celerator, reports Susan Post for Metropreneur, where David All and Christine Deye of Civic Hacks are focusing on helping new businesses through the process of becoming certified as B-corporations. (Yes, thats the same David All who was once Rep. Jack Kingstons communications director and the vanguard of a pod of young Republicans who pressed their party to embrace technology before it was cool.)


Theres a lot of nascent civic tech in this new round of Knight Prototype Fund grantees, each of whom is getting $35,000 in support, design training, and peer networking opportunities. The winners include Billcam (which aims to add transparency to the legislative process), CityGram (which makes it easier for local governments to connect with citizens), the U.S. Vote Foundations local election dates and deadlines API, IdeaMapr (which helps communities understand and join in on local government decision making), and @Stake by Emerson Colleges Engagement Lab.


Bryan Breckenridge and Anne Maloney of Box.org have authored a useful whitepaper on why its important to fund tech for nonprofits. They note that currently, most nonprofits spend no more than 10 percent of their budgets on tech, and many large NGOs allocate only 1 percent  2.5 percent of their annual income to tech. They add:
For many organizations that do fund tech, theyve limited it to the sexiest areas of program-side investment while ignoring an organizations need to shore up its foundational data and content collection, management, analytics, and sharing layer... the plumbing: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Constituent Relationship Management), ECM (Enterprise Content Management), Identity Management, communications systems, productivity and collaboration tools, grant management, etc. and the headcount and know-how to run them well. Underinvestment and lacking capacity in plumbing are two of the main reasons organizations struggle to scale overall and rise and crash in a highly turbulent project-to-project life cycle.


Speaking of which, Google.org is giving $2.35 million to community organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area that are on the forefront of the racial justice movement, Jessica Guynn reports for USA Today.

Todays unfortunately necessary civic tech must-read: Our good friend Deanna Zandt has written a detailed primer on Medium on what to do if you are getting harassed online. Complete with easy instructions on how to use BlockTogether.com, how to protect yourself on Facebook and Instagram, and how to deal with being doxxed.


Breaking: Longtime digital rights activist and New America fellow Rebecca MacKinnon is launching the Ranking Digital Rights project this morning at 10am ET with an event at Civic Hall (that Im moderating) which you can watch live. Writing for The Guardian, Sam Thielman previews the report, which scrutinizes the practices of eight top internet companies and eight top telecommunications companies. If this was a test, nearly everyone failed, MacKinnon says. No company clearly explains whether users can control what the company itself collects and shares about users, the reports executive summary notes. Furthermore, half of the companies do not explain whether users can access the information the company holds on them, and seven companies do not provide detail on how long they hold user information.


Endgame: Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig has suspended his quixotic bid for the White House, blaming an arbitrary rules change by the Democratic National Committee that now requires candidates to be at least at one percent in at least three national polls six weeks prior to the next debate. Lessig blogs, I was eager and happy to ask for support for the campaign when there was a prospect of getting into the debates. When there wasnt, I couldnt in good faith make that ask. When thats true, a campaign must end.  No word on whether his campaign has any money left to refund to its donors.


On the more hopeful side: Seattle is voting today on Initiative 122, known as the Honest Elections initiative, which would tighten campaign finance and lobbying rules and also set up a new system of democracy vouchers giving local citizens the ability to direct up to $100 in public funds to candidates of their choosing, Jack Horowiz reports for Mic.com. If enacted, the system would incentivize candidates to spend more time wooing ordinary voters, even poor ones.


Related: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, author of the Citizens United decision that let corporations spend unlimited amounts on elections, now admits that his expectation that internet-powered disclosure would deter corruption is not working the way it should, the Huffington Posts Paul Blumenthal reports. As Blumenthal archly noted, Kennedy should have known that his imagined disclosure regime was not working before the decision, either.


New on Civicist: Our Jessica McKenzie reports on Maplights plans to expand its Voters Edge voter guide from California to New York and Illinois in 2016.


No more open-washing? Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, writes that the Open Government Partnershipa signature initiative of the Obama Administrationshould make press freedom a sine qua non for participation, not an aspirational goal. Amen to that.

Votebnb: The sharing economy is on the ballot tomorrow in San Francisco, where Proposition F, which would limit short-term home rentals, is pitting Airbnb against the San Francisco tenants union, Conor Dougherty reports for the New York Times. He notes that several other ballot propositions are either directly or indirectly related to the technology industry and housing costs. In addition to the Airbnb thing, there are two affordable-housing measures and a proposal to help old-line businesses make rent in neighborhoods that are filling up with boutiques and organic restaurants.


Related: Nancy Watzman of the Internet Archive reports that, as that San Francisco vote nears, ads opposing Prop F are running at a rate of 100-1 compared to ads supporting the measure. Audio fingerprinting of YouTube-hosted advertising was used to identify the same ads in local station programming and cable news networks available in the region, from August 25 through October 26, she writes.


Unmasking: After months of relative quiet, the hacker network Anonymous is resurfacing this week with Operation KKK. Timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the Ferguson protests, the group has started posting personal contact information of people it alleges are KKK members, reports Anthony Cuthbertson of the International Business Times. The group claims Senators Tom Tillis (R-NC), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Dan Coats (R-IN) are Klan members, along with several mayors.

Following the money: Alessandra Stanley packed a lot of truth into this essay on Silicon Valleys New Philanthropy in Sundays New York Times. Most telling: for all his talk of disruption, the head of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Emmett Carson, which sits on nearly $5 billion from tech donors, has this to say about the Ford Foundations new focus on fighting income inequality: West Coast philanthropy is not influenced by East Coast pronouncements, he sniffed.


Related: Heres a progress report from four community foundations (including SVCF) on what they are learning from funding media projects that assist in meeting local information needs, written by Steve Outing and posted on the Knight Foundations blog.

This will make it possible for neighbors to network with neighbors around common concerns, and government officials to connect directly with each other. Either way, its an important qualitative improvement in SCFs platform, which just tallied its two-millionth user report.

mySocietys research director Rebecca Rumbul has released an important new study, Who benefits from civic technology? Its the first fruit of mySocietys big new thrust into user and impact research on civic tech. The report looks at variations in usage of civic techdefined as technologies that enable citizens to hold governments to accountin the U.S., U.K., Kenya, and South Africa, and examines the attitudes of users towards the platforms they are using. A total of 3,705 online survey responses were collected. The sites were FixMyStreet and TheyWorkForYou in the U.K., GovTrack and SeeClickFix in the U.S., Mzalendo in Kenya and Peoples Assembly in South Africa. (Other country sites were also in the study but did not generate enough user responses to be statistically useful.)


The report found that in the U.K. and the U.S., the vast majority of users of these sites (FixMyStreet and GovTrack, specifically) are older, with roughly half over the age of 55. The opposite is true in Kenya and South Africa. Men account for 2/3 or more of the users except in the U.S. case, where the gender breakdown was even. In the U.K. and South Africa, whites use these sites disproportionately more than their share of the population (that question was not included by the sites in the U.S. and Kenya). Across the board, these civic tech sites attract users who are not surprisingly highly political engaged and better educated than the general population.


Heres one of Rumbuls key normative findings: [the] data tells us that in the U.K. and U.S., civic technology users at least in some ways resemble the existing dominant class, and that this class has recognized the potential of civic technology to facilitate and amplify effective civic interaction, whether that be in tracking political information on welfare, researching legislative progress for professional purposes or maintaining the local community environment. This has significant implications for civic technology implementers. Many groups conceive of civic technology as a tool for effective and accessible democratic action. The digital environment is thought to reduce traditional barriers to engagement and access experienced by the less engaged groups within society. If, however, digital democracy tools are predominantly being used by a homogeneous group already dominant in society, this has the potential to skew policy and practical interventions in favor of this dominant group, at the same time compounding disadvantage amongst less dominant groups in society.


This is a very important and sobering conclusion. But we should be careful not to over-interpret this finding. mySocietys study did not look directly at economic class, so its possible that these civic tech platforms are actually helping empower some people who otherwise wouldnt be in the position to pay to play in the political arena the way the top one percent do. It also looked at a narrow band of civic tech platforms: the generic parliamentary transparency sites (GovTrack and TheyWorkForYou) and two community problem-solving platforms (FixMyStreet and SeeClickFix). Notably, it doesnt provide any user data from the SeeClickFix sample (by the way, the company hit its two-millionth report yesterday and is today launching some impressive new neighbor engagement features). It would be edifying to spread the net wider to include platforms like Vermonts Front Porch Forum and Minneapolis e-democracy, as well the growing array of mobile-centric civic engagement platforms. Finally, civic tech is a bigger field than just government accountability tools. Defining it that narrowly leaves out vital projects like Democracy Works, which focus on helping people register and vote; or the Smart Chicago Collaborative, which makes tools with its urban and working-class community, or whole urban ecosystems like what is happening in Detroit. As Microsofts CivicGraph shows, the civic tech ecosystem is much bigger than just the sites mySociety surveyed. So while the issues Rumbul raises are real, more research is needed before saying this is the whole story.


Mark Headd chews on the mySociety survey and takes heart that it shows that many users of these sites believe that they are useful, and that using them makes them more confident to engage public officials. But he also notes that if public officials arent more responsive as a result, the promise of accountability offered by these sites could lead to disillusionment.

This is civic tech: The annual NYC Big Apps competition just announced the 2015 semifinalists, in the categories of affordable housing, zero waste, connected cities and citizen engagement. Congrats to several Civic Hall members Melanie Lavelle of the Benefit Kitchen team, Maria Yuan of Issue Voter, and Sanjaya Punyasena of Simpolfy.


The Knight Foundation is giving $648,000 to MITs Laboratory for Social Machines for a new campaign analytics project called The Electome. Research scientist William Powers explains the projects goals: to move beyond the politicians and medias fixation on the horse race, and to listen more closely to citizen voices and see if candidates and journalists are responding to those concerns. Twitter has given the lab (which it funds) a gift for this project, toothe full firehouse of 500 million new tweets written each day. The project also plans to use data fro Facebook, Reddit and Google searches, and the Washington Post and Mashable will be working directly with it as well.


The Electome could be a transformative project, as a Knight press release outlines: In development since last spring, the Electome is designed to create real-time, comprehensive map tracking election-related content and show the connections between three main information sources: the media and journalists, messaging from the candidates, and public conversations on social media. It will look to use computer science tools, such as machine learning and natural language processing, to trace the elections narratives as they form, spread, morph and decline  identifying who and what influences these dynamics and outcomes.


Two questions from this corner: Will the Electomes algorithms be open for inspection by others? And will its editorial decisions be open? Lets hope so. Ill let you know what I find out.


Democratic presidential candidate Martin OMalley is taking his civic tech pitch competition to Bostons District Hall next Wednesday, Jon Chesto reports for the Boston Globe.


Luke Fretwell, the founder of the civic tech blog GovFresh, offers some useful suggestions on how to improve a set of proposals made by the states Little Hoover Commission. The bipartisan commission, which is tasked with government oversight, is calling on the governor and legislature to create a new post of chief customer officer along with an internal digital services team. It also wants the state government to focus on open data and human-centered design. 


The web we want? Writing for Fortune magazine, Mathew Ingram explains how Facebooks Instant Articles and Twitters new Moments feature are jointly killing the web link, and ponders whether that is bad thing. Heres one reason why it is, as he writes: because Facebook controls the algorithm that determines what users see or dont see, then it gets to decide what the news is, and what is important. And thats a potential problem if Facebook chooses to delete disturbing images or news stories about war and promote peaceful happy stories instead. In some cases, information disappears from Facebook and the social network never explains why.


Seventy-two feminist and civil rights organizations have asked the US Department of Education to issue guidelines to colleges that would urge them to ban Yik Yak and other anonymous social media apps in the interest of stopping the harassment of marginalized students, Amanda Hess reports for Slate. She argues that this is a dumb idea, and points out that while Yik Yak has been used on campuses by racists and homophobes to target students, it has also been used to quickly rally visible support for suicidal students and victims of homophobia. She also notes that no social network has been more aggressive about stemming harassment and encouraging community than Yik Yak has.

Government openings: As the Open Government Partnerships annual summit starts in Mexico City, Martin Tisne, the Omidyar Networks director of policy for its government transparency initiative, argues that its not enough for governments to promise to be more open with their data: Do we change the course of history with the mere existence of more data or because people access it, mobilize, and press for change?


Related: In tandem with the summit, the White House released its third Open Government National Action Plan, which it says both broadens and deepens efforts to help government become more open and more citizen-centered.


A We the People petition on the White House website demanding that President Obama publicly affirm his support for strong encryption has received more than 100,000 signatures, which means it is due an official response, Jenna McLaughlin reports for The Intercept.


Conference call: With BuzzFeed and Vox Media both threatening to withdraw from SXSW Interactive unless two controversial panels are reinstated, the festivals organizers are now considering an all-day event focused on combatting online harassment, Re/Codes Noah Kulwin reports. The Level Up panel on overcoming harassment has already been reinstated.


If you want to go even deeper into the rabbit hole of abuse and disinformation that afflict just about everyone who tries to take on the GamerGate trolls, read Arthur Chus piece in the Daily Beast about how SXSW mishandled a panel on improving online culture that he was involved in proposing.


Life in Facebookistan: Facebook is giving its employees the opportunity to experience what using the companys mobile app feels like to someone with a slow connection typical to the emerging markets the company is trying to conquer, Jillian DOnfrio reports for Business Insider. The initiative, which is called 2G Tuesdays and is supposed to help close the empathy gap' between Silicon Valley and emerging markets, works like this: When a Facebook employee logs in to the app any Tuesday morning, theyll see a prompt at the top of their News Feed asking whether they want to try out the slower connection for an hour. For that next hour, their experience on Facebook will be very much like the experience that millions of people around the world have on Facebook on a 2G connection, Facebook engineering director Tom Alison says. Theyre going to see the places that we need to improve our product, but theyre also going to see the places where we have made a lot of progress.


No word on whether Facebook employees will also be given the opportunity to take public transit to work instead of its private San Francisco shuttle bus service, or be offered the opportunity to buy their own food and do their own dry-cleaning.

Todays civic tech must-read: Rachel Cohen, a writing fellow at the American Prospect, argues in Pushing civic tech beyond its comfort zone (a feature article in its Fall 2015 print issue) that technologists who talk about revolutionizing local government by improving its IT, making it more responsive, transparent, data-driven and cost-effective are set[ting] up people for later disappointment. She writes, Accountability, however, is ultimately a political matter, and civic tech cannot simply steer clear of politics in the belief that technology will solve problems on its own. Among the civic tech leaders cited in her piece: Ben Berkowitz of SeeClickFix, Stephen Goldsmith and Susan Crawford (co-authors of The Responsive City: Engaging Communities Through Data-Smart Governance), Sean Moulton of the Project on Government Oversight, Tiago Peixoto of the World Bank, Dan ONeil of the Smart Chicago Collaborative, Haley Van Dyck of the U.S. Digital Service, Sheila Krumholz of the Center for Responsive Politics and Eric Liu of Citizen University. Oh, and some dude named Sifry and some conference called Personal Democracy Forum.


Just launched by Political Animal and Poderopedia: NarcoData, a digital platform tracking 40 years of Mexicos drug cartels, including their emergence, geographic expansion, international relationships and criminal activities.


Embattled Empaneled: Hugh Forrest, the longtime organizer of SXSW Interactive, has announced that two previously announced sessions related to online harassment and gaming cultureone that was seen as pro-GamerGate and one that was nothave been canceled due to numerous threats of on-site violence related to this programming. (GamerGate refers to a loose-knit online network that has viciously targeted women in the gaming industry.) Forrests statement noted that SXSWs big tent of ideas requires civil and respectful dialogue and that if a safe and secure place that is free of online and offline harassment cannot be assured, the sanctity of that big tent would be compromised. Not explained by his statement: why the conference organizers couldnt assure sufficient on-site security for these two panels to take place.


Level Up: Overcoming Harassment in Games, was the non-GamerGate panel canceled by SXSW. On Twitter, one of its organizers, Randi Harper of the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative, shared a stream of protests about the decision, noting that we didnt demand that the GamerGate panel be removed from the schedule. We just asked that safety precautions be taken. She also noted, Our panel was not about GamerGate, but instead making design decisions in abuse systems.


Another co-panelist, Katherine Cross of CUNY Graduate Center, said, The panel was meant to be a wide-ranging discussion about how we might design websites, social media, and online games to be less susceptible to online harassment and hate mobbing. We were going to discuss various design proposals, including some already extant in the gaming industry that have been proven to work, but our panel was meant to be a solutions-oriented discussion of harassment in general. She also told Austin Walker of Giant Bomb News that SXSW had not alerted her panel about threats of violence before announcing their panels cancellation.


The other canceled panel, SavePoint: A Discussion on the Gaming Community, featured several supporters of the GamerGate movement. Perry Jones of the Open Gaming Society says the group is raising money to hold its panel during SXSW somewhere nearby.


As Noah Kulwin writes for Re/Code, SXSWs decision shows that The online hate mob of Gamergate is good at two things: Sending horrible threats to women online, and forcing people to shut down events featuring people critical of Gamergate.


Digital politics: The White House is disagreeing with FBI Directer James Comeys recent claims that increased scrutiny of local police behavior and fear of officers that their actions will go viralthe so-called YouTube effectis leading to a rise in violent crime in some cities, Michael Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo report for the New York Times. The evidence we have seen so far doesnt support the contention that law enforcement officials are shirking their responsibilities, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in response to a question about Comeys remarks.


A new study from the Brennan Center for Justice, Voter Registration in a Digital Age: 2015 Update looks at the 38 states that now offer electronic and/or online registration and finds that it is boosting registration rates, increasing voter roll accuracy, and saving money.


With the help of his newly installed senior enforcement counsel Tim Wu, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has told Verizon, Time Warner, and Cablevision that he is probing whether their so-called super-fast premium internet connections are actually ripping off customers with slower-than-advertised speeds, Christie Smythe reports for Bloomberg Business.


The news from Facebookistan: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is continuing his charm offensive in China, giving a speech in Mandarin while on a visit to Tsinghua University in Beijing (where he is on the board of its school of economics and management), the Los Angeles Times reports.


Meanwhile, as Vindu Goel reports for the New York Times, Facebooks Internet.org project (which was recently renamed Free Basics) is struggling to gain acceptance in India. As Goel notes, one of Facebooks local telco partners, Reliance, is known for shoddy service. And as he writes, one phone shop owner told him, Even if Reliances network were good...the package excludes WhatsApp, a popular messaging app owned by Facebook, and users must pay to see the photos in their Facebook feeds. If you have to pay for data, whats the point of calling it free? he said.


Your moment of zen: Former President Bill Clinton tells Mark Halperin of Bloomberg Politics that he likes the selfie phenomenon. In a way I like it, though, because its democratized record-keeping of memoriesbecause if you can afford a cell phone, youve got a camera, and a camera will operate at a fairly high resolution, with a fairly good amount of clarity, and if you need to for some reason you can print it out. He also joked that if selfies existed back in the 1980s when he first entered politics in Arkansas, he might not have lived to run for President. I did not have a selfie with that woman. No, he didnt say that.

Todays civic tech must-read: Civicist contributing editor An Xiao Mina writing on our failures of our global imagination. Read the whole thing. Afterwards, you probably wont think about the First World or the Third World in the same way, or how we use our devices.


Tech and the presidentials: When GOP presidential candidate Scott Walker dropped out of the race, none of the other Republican campaigns sought to pick up his digital team, and as Issie Lapowsky reports for Wired, this may be the latest evidence that conservatives are still lagging behind liberals in how much they prioritize tech for their campaigns.


Surging Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson is heavily reliant on Facebook, where he has 4.3 million fans, David Drucker reports for the Washington Examiner. Carson personally takes and answers three questions every night on his Facebook page; the interaction generates an average of 100,000 responses that are shared approximately 10,000 times.


Doug Watts, Carsons chief communications counselor, tells Drucker: ...we all came in sharing the ethic of having a social media-orientedcentriccampaign, because we were all totally taken with [President] Obamas campaign in 2007 and 2008, and of course no Republican has even come close to exercising that kind of a program. And we thought you could.

Sanders top adviser Tad Devine explains: He is not a big consumer of polling, so he did not see the need for it, but I think he understands it in terms of targeting media buys and for voter contact that it has value and can save us money because we wont waste resources by, for example, buying the wrong shows on TV.

Todays civic-tech must-read: Our own Andrew Rasiej reflects in Civicist on this weeks third annual CityLab conference, hosted by The Atlantic magazine, the Bloomberg Foundation and the Aspen Institute, which he attended in London. He writes that the movement to innovate government using technology has never been more robust, but warns: we are all missing something fundamental that is preventing any of our collective work from becoming transformative....All of us in the field of government re-invention will fail unless we bring our energy and ideas to the urgent need to innovate the political processes that deliver to us the government we truly want.


He adds, The theory that government innovation will eventually be so successful that its benefits will trickle back up the food chain and deliver us better politics is a false premise. Politics is the horse and government is the cart and we can have the fanciest cart on the planet but it is being pulled by an elephant and a donkey that when combined cast a shadow that looks like a pig. (And leaves just as bad a mess.)

Todays civic tech must-reads: danah boyd, founder of the Data and Society Institute, on What World Are We Building, in which she reminds us how technology mirrors and amplifies existing patterns in society: Data is power.

About that other election: Canadians are voting today in national elections that could remove the ruling Conservative party from power. Its only been an eleven-week campaign, which for Canadians is apparently too long, Ben Terris reports for the Washington Post. (If American national elections were that truncated, the whole political campaign/tech industry would probably go up in smoke.) 


Heres a backgrounder from Google Canada on the role the internet is playing in #elxn42 (thats the hashtag you want to follow). Some interesting tidbits: 30 percent of Canadians say the internet is their primary information source for politics. A similar number are digital-only and have no cable TV or satellite connection. Voters who favor a change in government are more likely to rely on the internet for news. And 56 percent of Canadian voters say they have used a search engine to fact check something a candidate or party has said.


Evan Solomons review of the campaigns major turning points explains fairly well how the change theme has played in the election and why it is likely to put Liberal Party candidate Justin Trudeau into power.


Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harpers declaration that he opposed the niqabstating that he wouldnt permit a Muslim woman to wear the traditional veil during a citizenship ceremonyapparently got the most interactions on Facebook, ITBusiness.ca reports. The Conservatives tried to capitalize on that attention by announcing a police hotline for people to report barbaric cultural practices.


The Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau has promised to pour nearly a billion dollars into the countrys start-up and innovation sectors, the CBC reported.


Heres a binder full of some of the sillier social media blowups of the Canadian election campaign, courtesy of Micki Cowan of CBC News.

Nextdoors CEO Nirav Tolia has responded to the allegations that users of the site have racial profiled their neighbors, and says that the company will make appropriate changes to the platform, Sam Levin reports for the East Bay Express. Writing on the Nextdoor blog, Tolia said: We are incredibly saddened that some neighbors have used Nextdoor in this way. Simply stated: we consider profiling of any kind to be unacceptable.

The internet declared Hillary Clinton the winner of the Democratic debate last night, Alan Rappeport reports for the New York Times, although everyone quoted works in media, with the exception of two pollsters, and the internet in this case is decidedly the medium for, not the entity itself, weighing in.


The Congressional Management Foundation has released a new report detailing how Congress acts and reacts on social media. Two gleaned factoids indicate that the volume of feedback can be modest, but that promptness matters. From the press release: 80 percent of staff surveyed said 30 or fewer responses to their social media posts are enough to get the office to pay attention. But the survey also indicates that staff tend to review only those reactions posted within the first 24 hours.

Tech and the presidentials: Adam Pasick and Tim Fernholz report for Quartz on The Groundwork, an until-now little-known tech vendor for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign that is funded by Google billionaire Eric Schmidt and run by Michael Slaby, the CTO of Barack Obamas 2008 campaign. They write: Groundwork has been tasked with building the technological infrastructure to ingest massive amounts of information about voters, and develop tools that will help the campaign target them for fundraising, advertising, outreach, and get-out-the-vote effortsessentially to create a political version of a customer relationship management (CRM) system, like the one that Salesforce.com runs for commerce, but for prospective voters. In other words, Groundwork is supposed to solve the data integration problem that has bedeviled modern campaigns since the dawn of time.


Pasick and Fernholz deftly point out that Schmidts investment in the Groundwork has allowed him to avoid the complex dance required of Super PACs that supposedly dont coordinate with campaigns: a well-connected donor like Schmidt can fund a startup to do top-grade work for a campaign, with the financial outlay structured as an investment, not a donation.


The Irvine Foundation has published a new report, Testing New Technologies in Mobilizing Voters of Color. It found that personal contact is still the most effective way to turn out voters, beating texting voters or using Facebook ads to urge them to vote. (Is that really surprising?) The report notes that since the study took place in the context of the 2014 off-year election, voter attention was lower. The study did not look at how the use of voter targeting or mobile canvassing tools might improve voter turnout.


Brave new world: In the last ten years, social media usage by American adults has zoomed from 7 percent to 65 percent, Pew Research Centers Andrew Perrin reports. The shift has been pronounced even among people over the age of 65, of whom 35 percent now use social media.


The internet is a mirror of the real world, sometimes making more visible what was invisible and sometimes amplifying our worst impulses. Thats the import of this long and incredibly detailed story by Sam Levin of the East Bay Express on how white Oakland residents are increasingly using Nextdoor.com to racially profile their black neighbors. Roughly 20 percent of all Nextdoor conversations in Oakland are about crime and safety, he reports. Levins story is nuanced enough to point out that the problem predates Nextdoor, noting that when listservs starting gaining usage in Oakland they also became hotbeds for rumor-mongering. He also notes that the company, which has more than $100 million in venture funding and has expanded rapidly in the city in recent years, isnt responding to concerns that its neighborhood social networking sites are intensifying white racism. If anything, the company seems to like that it is becoming a de facto neighborhood watch platform.


Pulitzer-winning national security report Barton Gellman describes how the video a public talk on the NSA and Edward Snowden he gave at Purdue University in late September was scrubbed from the schools website after someone reported to the Defense Security Service that a few of his slides were still officially classified even though they have been widely reported in the press.

Bostons data-driven city managers are now trying to combine all of their data on everything from crime to housing to Wi-Fi availability and turn it into a single numeric, called CityScore, reports Jess Bidgood for the New York Times.

This is civic tech: Civicist contributing editor Laurenellen McCann writes about the work of the Center for Technology and Civic Life with election administrators around the country, and how they decided to prioritize co-production above tool production, letting the administrators guide the process. The result is ELECTricity: A learning community of election officials who believe that technology can improve our democracy. McCann says this is a model of build with, not for civic tech, and adds that we have more collaboration we need to do if we want our civic work to truly be transformative. We have to learn how to work not just with tech communities and particular government partners of interest, but also in deep partnership with the wide array of civic actors and organizations already enmeshed and working in the democratic landscapes we are trying to affect.

Rich thinking: Mark Pincus of Zynga thinks itd be pretty cool for a million people to raise one billion dollars to run Mike Bloomberg for president. Through Kickstarter. His friend Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn says its not going to happen. Thats just one highlight of Nicholas Lemanns lengthy New Yorker profile of Hoffman, todays must-read.
    



Given that both Pincus and Hoffman dropped one million dollars each on President Obamas re-election Priorities USA Super PAC, and Hoffman tossed Lawrence Lessigs MayDayPAC another million in 2014, you have to pay attention to how they talk about reviving civic engagement. Check out this idea from Pincus:
Summer of Love. Should I remind you of the concept? The idea is that, in 2017, its the fiftieth anniversary of the original Summer of Love in San Francisco. Can we use that to generate a year-long summer of service? Pincus explained that a series of rock concerts might be organized, offering tickets competitively through a new app. Start in San Francisco. It could be gamified civic engagement. Its a different narrative for tech. Its not the narrative thats been written for us. Its disruption on an establishment level, not a tech level. I spoke to Bono about it, and he went nuts!




Speaking of big money and civic engagement, of the more than 18,000 grants since 2011 cataloged by the Foundation Center as focused on strengthening American democracy, just 962 have been focused on technology. Thats just $215 million out of a total of $2.435 billion, and just six foundationsKnight, Ford, Gates, Omidyar, the California Endowment, and Sloanhave provided more than half of that. In a guest op-ed for Philanthropy News Digest, I look at why so many major American foundations dont seem to get tech.




Tech and the presidentials: Heres our Jessica McKenzie reporting on Sen. Marco Rubios appearance at Civic Hall yesterday to talk about the on-demand economy.




Issie Lapowsky of Wired also reports on Rubios tech talk at Civic Hall.




This is civic tech: The New York State Senate has just launched the most innovative legislative website in the country, Jessica McKenzie reports for Civicist. A new feature shows senators up-to-the-minute constituent support for and opposition to proposed bills.




Lawrence Grodeska, founder of the Civicmakers Meetup in San Francisco, takes his stab at defining civic tech, arguing that it is as a new big tent movement for democracy that encapsulates many smaller segments, such as gov tech, online campaigning, digital advocacy, and voting tech.




Food for thought: If you are political activist who uses social media, you should read this interview by Kate Aronoff in Waging Nonviolence with Elijah Armstrong and Rachel Gilmer of Floridas Dream Defenders, who have been at the epicenter there in the Movement for Black Lives. Theyre in the middle of a six-week self-imposed social media sabbatical, which theyve taken because theyre unhappy with how the culture of 24-7 online engagement is warping their work.

Tech and the presidentials: Speaking at Civic Hall this morning, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said in a prepared speech that both parties were to blame for not innovating fast enough to keep up with the on-demand economy (his preferred descriptor). He also decried regulations lobbied for by incumbent interests like the taxi industry and the hotel industry for blocking the growth of companies like Uber and Airbnb.
Rubio also touted Handy, which helps self-employed trades professionals get jobs, for enabling upward mobility and offering people greater flexibility to choose their work hours, noting that the average Handy worker makes $18 an hour. He said it was shameful that the biggest obstacle to growth of this company was our very own government. He concluded: We have to change the way our political establishment thinks about the new economy.


During a Q&A session with Civic Hall founder Andrew Rasiej, Rubio declared that he wasnt in favor of eliminating the federal minimum wage (contrary to prior reports) but that he opposed raising it.


Asked about the U.S. Digital Service and whether he would continue it were he elected president, he said If it proves that its something that is effective and that it can attract the brightest minds to improve how government works, then thats something we should definitely continue.

Our Jessica McKenzie covered the event in a bit more detail for Civicist.

The future of work: The Guardians Alex Hern argues its time to stop referring to the sharing economy, saying that the gig economy is a much better descriptor for whats actually going on: a dependence on tenuous labor, particularly that provided by individuals working as third-party contractors rather than full employees.


A recent survey by the Freelancers Union found that nearly 54 million people, or one-third of the work force, are doing freelance work. According to the survey, 86 percent of the nations freelancers are likely to vote in 2016, and 62 percent are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports freelancers interests.


As Katie Benner reports for the New York Times, politicians are turning more to gig economy startups like Thumbtack, Munchery, and Managed by Q, for advice on how to address their needs.


Related: On October 7, Michelle Miller of Coworker.org is co-hosting a White House town hall with President Obama to discuss the future of work and the importance of worker voice. You can submit a question in advance here. (Heres Coworkers Jess Kutch speaking at PDF 2015 last June about the power of employee-led online organizing.)


Brave new world: An in-depth report by Mother Jones Mark Follman on data-driven efforts by threat assessment professionals to intervene before mass killers take action includes this troubling news: When I asked threat assessment experts what might explain the recent rise in gun rampages, I heard the same two words over and over: social media. Although there is no definitive research yet, widespread anecdotal evidence suggests that the speed at which social media bombards us with memes and images exacerbates the copycat effect.


Self-described budding young journalist Eve Peyser managed to interview notorious pharmaceutical price-gouger Martin Shkreli by swiping right on his profile on the Tinder dating app, as she details in this piece for Mic.com.


Exile watch: Edward Snowden has offered to go to prison in the U.S. as part of a plea deal that would allow him to come home, but as Ewen MacAskill reports for the Guardian, he says he wont serve as a deterrent to people trying to do the right thing in difficult situations. But, he adds, the U.S. Justice Department has made no effort to contact him to discuss any plea deal.

Future, Imperfect: In America, Google searches for gun shop tend to be more popular than gun control but after the mass shooting in Oregon late last week, that trend flipped, Lorenzo Ligato reports for the Huffington Post. Among the top queries people ask are, What do police say about gun control? and Why does nothing get done about gun control?


According to Google search trends, public interest in America in a mass shooting tends to last a month, at best, Emily Badger and Kevin Schaul report for the Washington Post. They write, It doesnt gradually recede with time as memories often do; it disappears, abruptly.


A proposal that would let Uber and Lyft drivers form nonprofit organizations to collectively bargain on their behalf is making progress through the Seattle city council, Daniel Beekman reports for the Seattle Times.


Tech and the presidentials: The presidential candidate with the most Facebook followers is....Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon. As Jon Ward reports for Yahoo Politics, Carson has more than 4 million followers, compared to 3.9 million for Donald Trump, 2.1 million for Bernie Sanders, 1.5 million for Hillary Clinton, and 1 million for Marco Rubio. Carsons success online mirrors his broad base of small donors, who gave his campaign $20 million in the third quarter of 2015.


Meanwhile, Donald Trump has become the champion of Twitter, as this devastating profile from Michael Barbaro in the New York Times shows. He writes: Over the past two months, on Twitter alone, he has been mentioned in 6.3 million conversations, eight times as many as Republican rivals like Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carsonnot to mention more than three times as many as Hillary Rodham Clinton and nearly four times as many as Bernie Sanders. He is retweeted more than twice as often as Mrs. Clinton and about 13 times more frequently than Jeb Bush, according to data compiled as of Friday by Edelman Berland, a market research firm that studies social media.


Long-shot Democratic presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig, who crowdfunded $1 million in order to run a one-issue campaign for political reform, takes to Politico Magazine to complain that the Democratic party has been refusing to recognize his candidacy, preventing him from qualifying for this months first presidential debate.


This is civic tech: In Civicist, Daniel X. ONeil of the Smart Chicago Collaborative explains why The Real Heart of Civic Tech Isnt Code but the hidden workers like the teens who worked in its youth-led tech program this summer, the regular Chicago residents who work in its documenters program, and its health navigators. He writes:

Civic tech that doesnt include people like Akya, Angel, and Farhad leads to a distorted vision of the field. A vision that leads with technical solutions rather than human capacity. A vision that glorifies the power of the developer rather than the collective strengths of a city.

The view from the summit: My favorite statement at this weeks Code for America Summit, which was attended by more than 1,200 people, was uttered by Boston CIO Jascha Franklin-Hodge, who explained why he was tired of hearing about why government should be run like a business. He said, Businesses get to choose their customers, government has to serve everyone.


Catherine Bracy, the director of community organizing at Code for America, explains to re/Codes Noah Kulwin the dangers of the app trap. She says,
Its really hard to point to when weve changed a system or weve improved some massive bureaucracy. Its often years in the making. To separate the milestones along the way of this systemic story, we fall back on talking about the apps weve built, and the way the apps sort of represent a milestone or bigger picture. And that leads us into the app trap [that] now colors the conversation. Oh, youre just about building apps. And the app is the end of the story. But its not.


GovTechs Jason Shueh offers his four key takeaways from the Code for America Summit.


This is civic tech: Kudos to Travis Moore on the launch of TechCongress, a new nonpartisan fellowship program that will place technologists in Congressional offices. Moore is a former legislative and operations director to Rep. Henry Waxman. The fellowship is a nine-month residency working directly for a Member or a Committee. Fellows may focus on technology-related issues like NSA surveillance reform, patent reform, cybersecurity or network neutrality.

Food for thought: Ioby.org board member Justin Garrett Moore makes a plea that we stop using the term blight to describe the challenges facing urban communities. He writes:
Why do I consider blight a problematic word when it comes to describing our cities and communities? Blight is a borrowed term from plant pathology that refers to a number of diseases that cause damage and death. The violence of urban renewal (versions 1.0, 2.0 and now 3.0 beta) used this terminology of disease to describe a place and its people to justify the use of constitutional police power the betterment of the health, safety, morals to take property and wealth, remove people, and to literally destroy places.

Tech and the presidentials: Voxs Ezra Klein has noticed that The tools that party insiders use to decide both electoral and legislative outcomes are being weakened by new technologies and changing media norms, and posits that this explains why outsiders and insurgents like Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Bernie Sanders are doing much better than party insiders want and media elites would expect. Couched that carefully, Kleins statement isnt really controversial, though clickbait being what it is, he portentously titled his post, A theory of how American politics is changing.
    

Not surprisingly, Mother Jones Kevin Drum disagrees that anything that seismic has happened.


My view: Sanders (who is close to hitting the million mark in his small donor totalone-fourth the total number of donors Barack Obama had in 2008 by the end of the election) is clearly benefiting from his and his supporters mastery of online media. I suspect that Trump, Carson and Fiorina are benefiting more from rightwing talk radio. But either way, the old Gang of 500 (Mark Halperins term for the campaign consultants, strategists, pollsters, pundits, and journalists who make up the modern-day political establishment) has far less influence over the winnowing process than ever.

The news from Facebookistan: Facebook now has a social good team, led by longtime manager Naomi Gleit, reports Seth Figerman for Mashable. He writes, Facebooks social good team, which numbers in the dozens, is less focused on activism and on-the-ground work than building a new suite of products that tap into the social causes and personal needs of its community. Gleit told him, It really is bottom up. We dont want to do whatever Mark thinks is most important or whatever I think is most important. Thats not the position we want to be in.


Perhaps this is unfair, but can we please not use social good and products that tap into in the same sentence? At least put those phrases in separate sentences?

Caitlin Dewey has a must-read piece in the Washington Post on the failure of major tech companies to offer their platforms or skills in the face of Europes humanitarian crisis, comparing their inaction to the swiftness with which they have deployed their tools (and, it might be added, PR teams) to respond to natural disasters like earthquakes. She reports that to date:
...no private firms have partnered with ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] to develop tools or technologies to help European refugees, and no one seems interested in doing much more than flinging money at charity. Neither Facebook nor Google has launched their safety check-up features in Europe, for instance, though both did after Nepals earthquake earlier this year....Microsoft-owned Skype, which has periodically made calls free after major storms and other natural disasters, hasnt extended the same courtesy to the hundreds of thousands of people now stranded in such places as Hungary and Croatia.

Instead, Dewey writes, it is volunteer civic techies like Berlins Fluchtlinge Wilkommen (Welcome Refugees) that have started to step into the gap, but they are overwhelmed by demand and having trouble raising money at the same time. (Go here if you want to donate to them.)
Pope Francis made reference to technology in his address to Congress yesterday, the Huffington Posts Alex Howard notes. It was not to his @pontifex Twitter feed, however, but to to his hope that we put technology at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.
Speaking of more integral uses of technology, Lucy Bernholz, Rob Reich, Emma Saunders-Hastings, and Emma Leeds Armstrong have developed a basic framework for ethical, safe, and effective use of digital data by civil society organizations. It has three key principles that make a lot of sense: Default to person-centered consent. Prioritize privacy and minimum viable data collection. Plan from the beginning to open (share) your work.
Deep inside this very detailed story by Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt for The Guardian on how backbencher Jeremy Corbyn won his unlikely bid to be the new leader of the UKs Labour party is this fascinating tidbit:
The digital teams secret weapon was a soft-spoken young tech expert named Ben Soffa. As the TSSAs head of digital operationswho happens to be Cat Smiths partnerSoffa was seconded to the Corbyn campaign by his union to try to give it an edge over the other campaigns, which were thought to have been vastly better prepared. Soffa created an appusing the American political organising software NationBuilderthat allowed volunteers to make calls to potential supporters from their own homes. The app provided information about an individuals Labour membership, which constituency they lived in and its electoral history. Volunteers would follow a series of questions, with the answers fed back to Soffas team through the app. The data coming back to Soffa showed a clear pattern by the end of June: Corbyn was garnering surprising levels of support from across the party, especially from the so-called three pounderspeople who had signed up to vote as registered supporters. The figures were so good that the Corbyn camp assumed they must be incorrect. The numbers are amazing, but it must just be that were finding all of Jeremys core supporters, Soffa told Smith towards the end of June. Another coup by the Corbyn camp was the prescient decision to embed the 3 registration process directly into the campaigns websiteensuring that thousands of people who visited the website were easily able to sign up. It was just an obvious, natural thing to do, Soffa recalledbut the other campaigns did not think to do it, an oversight they all now regret.

In the face of a broad backlash across the developing world, Facebook has quietly decided to rename its controversial Internet.org program Free Basics by Facebook, Newley Purnell reports for the Wall Street Journal.
The city of Boston is going to use private data from social traffic app Waze to figure out if its Dont Block the Box program actually reduces traffic jams and speeds up travel, Curt Woodward reports for BetaBoston.

Our brave new future: As the Volkswagen case demonstrates, a smart object can lie and cheat, writes technosociologist Zeynep Tufekci in the New York Times. And, she notes, we shouldnt worry just about smart objects like cars, but also take note of the dangers of non-auditable voting machines.
Related: Jim Dwyer of the New York Times turns to Columbia Universitys Eben Moglen, a longtime advocate of software transparency, to explain the lesson of the Volkswagen scandal: Intelligent public policy, as we all have learned since the early 20th century, is to require elevators to be inspectable, and to require manufacturers of elevators to build them so they can be inspected, Moglen said. If Volkswagen knew that every customer who buys a vehicle would have a right to read the source code of all the software in the vehicle, they would never even consider the cheat, because the certainty of getting caught would terrify them. The code in cars is, in fact, tightly protected under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Dwyer notes.

Women are being asked inappropriately personal and family-related questions on stage at major tech conferences, Margaret Gould Stewart writes in Medium, and it is a waste of an opportunity for the participants on and off stage alike. Stewart argues that interviewers should either pose the same questions to men, or to stop asking them full stop. She also complains that the conference gift bags are sometimes tailored exclusively to men, which would annoy me, too.



Array of Things: Susan Crawford reports for Mediums Backchannel on the sensor network that will soon be taking up residence in Chicago, tracking and reporting air quality, pedestrian traffic, ambient noise levels, and more. With $3 million in funding from the National Science Foundation, Chicago plans to deploy 500 devices by the end of 2017.



Ive seen innovation every damn day of my life and very little of it gets love from the likes of Silicon Valley, writes Samala, in a piece published on Medium that touches on the tech culture in San Francisco and the greater Valley, neglected civic tech endeavors, and why she personally no longer believes that the Bay Area is a mecca of innovation:
    Put simply: The industry is not building products and services that will change all lives for the better.




Speaking of Silicon Valley, Geoffrey A. Fowlers Wall Street Journal review of the iPhone 6s calls it the stickiest iPhone yet, a trap meant to wed us to Apple services and software and keep us there til death do us part.

The civic tech community is in mourning at the untimely death of Jake Brewer, senior technology advisor to the White House, who was killed Saturday while on a charity bike ride in Virginia. Here is President Obamas statement on his passing. It reads, in part:

We set out to recruit the best of the best to join their government and help us harness the power of technology and data to innovate new solutions for the 21st century. Simply put, Jake was one of the best. Armed with a brilliant mind, a big heart, and an insatiable desire to give back, Jake devoted his life to empowering people and making government work better for them.


U.S. Chief Technology Office Megan Smith said, in part, He had a generous heart and a vision for engaging with technology, data, and most importantly each other, to create opportunity and find solutions together. Jake lived and loved more in his 34 years than some people do in their whole lives.


Jakes wife, Mary Katharine Hamm, a Fox News contributor, shared her feelings on her Instagram account.

Tech and the presidentials: Remember during the Republican National Convention in 2008 when Sarah Palin belittled Barack Obamas role as a community organizer, and a rapid-response email from the Obama campaign pulled in $10 million in donations from supporters in response? Its not quite the same scale, but more than a year earlier in the process, an attack on candidate Bernie Sanders by Correct the Record, a SuperPac aligned with Hillary Clinton, that compared him to the new leader of the British Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has generated more than $1.2 million in rapid donations to Sanders campaign, Sam Stein and Samantha Lachman report for the Huffington Post.


Weve never seen an immediate donor response like what the Sanders campaign received on Tuesday. At one point, it drove 180 contributions through our platform per minute, Erin Hill, executive director of ActBlue, told Stein and Lachman. Over its 11-year history ActBlue has sent money to over eleven-thousand campaigns and committeesand the Bernie Sanders campaign holds the record for the two biggest donor days ever for a campaign on our platform.


The Bing Pulse analysis of Wednesday nights GOP debate, while not a scientifically representative sampling of viewer responses, offers some fun findings nonetheless.

The Internet Public Speaks: Since yesterday, more than 1,000,000 tweets have included the hashtag #IStandWithAhmed, according to Topsy.


As Manny Fernandez and Christine Hauser report for the New York Times, the massive wave of support for the 14-year-old Texas boy arrested for bringing his clock invention to school included President Obama, who tweeted his support for Ahmed Mohamed and invited him to the White House.


The police now say they wont pursue charges against Mohamed, the Dallas Morning News Avi Selk reports. The boys new Twitter account has 72,000 followers. As Selk reports:

The joke to his big sisters, Ayisha and Eyman, is that Ahmed was invisible on social media before an outcry over his arrest made him an online sensation. Their tech whiz of a brother had no Twitter account, no Facebook, no Instagram or Snapchat. So the sisters set him up on Twitter as @IStandWithAhmeda slogan that the world had given the boy as his story spread overnight. The young women stared at their phones Wednesday morning, stunned as the phrase became one of the most popular memes of the day.


These two photos of an Arab-looking man of Syrian descent in a garage w/his accomplice building what appears to be a bomb also got a lot of retweets.


This is civic tech: The winner of St. Louis GlobalHack V last weekend, which focused on creating solutions to improve the working of the citys court system, was Inveo, which, according to Matt Meniette, Global Hacks executive director, developed a platform called CommuniSee that allowed residents to easily look up and resolve tickets through a variety of methods (e.g. by name and birthdate or through a simple map). Their solution also introduced a new way for residents, municipalities, and the private sector to collaborate to reduce the number of outstanding fines and fees: a tool for corporations or nonprofits to pay off outstanding fees in exchange for volunteer work and help hard-working individuals (many of whom may already be volunteering in their community) get a fresh start.


A recent consulting project between the Department of Defense and 18F saved the DOD $150 million by taking a more technically informed approach to procurement, Federal Times Aaron Boyd reports. Thats more than the entire $105 million currently requested for the whole U.S. Digital Service.


April Glaser and Alison Macrina report for Slate on how the citizens of Lebanon, New Hampshire, came out in force Tuesday night in support of their library reinstating its Tor relay for safe, anonymous web browsing, which had been suspended after an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security. By evenings end, the librarys board voted to restore the relay. Glaser and Macrina report that dozens of libraries have contacted the Library Freedom Project as a result of the controversy, hoping to set up their own Tor nodes. They add, This weeks victory for Lebanon Libraries is a sign of hope in a post-Snowden world.


The Open State Foundation has uploaded its full Politwoops archive of more than 1.1 million deleted tweets by more than ten thousand politicians in thirty-five counties to the Internet Archive.


Tech and the presidentials: If you want to see how people watching last nights GOP debate responded in real-time on Bing Pulse, check out this page. The three questions that came from social media, as CNN anchor Jake Tapper put it, raising the issues of medical marijuana, guns, and climate change, were a refreshing break from typical debate questions that tend to focus on personalities and the horserace.

Teach our children well: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is announcing today that within ten years all city schools will be required to offer computer science to all students, Kate Taylor and Claire Cain Miller report for the New York Times. Only one percent of the citys students now get to take computer classes. Half of the $81 million to be spent to achieve this ambitious goal will come from private donors, including the AOL Charitable Foundation, the Robin Hood Foundation, and Fred and Joanne Wilson.


De Blasio might want to dispatch a few of his yet-to-be-hired computer whiz teachers to Irving, Texas, where a 14-year-old high schooler named Ahmed Mohamed was arrested Monday after his teachers called police because he brought a homemade digital clock to school and they mistook it for a bomb. As Avi Selk reports for the Dallas Morning News, the schools principal threatened to expel him if he didnt make a signed statement while being interrogated by cops and hes now been suspended for three days. Mohamed has vowed never to take an invention to school again, Selk writes.


The boys case is now blowing up online, Nicole Stockdale reports for the Dallas Morning News, with many supporters using the hashtag #IStandWithAhmed.


This photo of Ahmed Mohamed as he was walked through school in handcuffs, surrounded by cops, was shared by his sister. Yes, hes wearing a NASA t-shirt.


The city of Irving was last in the national news after its mayor claimed to be blocking the establishment of a sharia law court in the city. Politifact investigated that claim and found it to be false, noting that all that happened was a few Muslim individuals teamed up to offer Sharia-governed, non-binding mediation services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, including in Irving, with the declared intent of complying with state and federal laws.

Isnt it interesting what the internet public rallies around? Ahmed Mohameds case, which has instantly galvanized nerds and social justice warriors alike (some of whom are the same peopleIm thinking of the amazing Anil Dash, who is at the center of organizing support for Mohamed), is arguably the polar opposite of the Donald Trump phenomenon: smart instead of dumb, embracing the other instead of demonizing him.

California is on the verge of becoming the second state (after Oregon) to automatically register residents to vote, Andrew Prokop reports for Vox.

Writing for Politico, Andrew Zaleski uses Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) comments at Personal Democracy Forum 2015 as a jumping off point to discuss just how bad the state of tech in the Legislative Branch can bedeplorable, according to one chief of staff who did time in Silicon Valley. The co-founder of the Congressional Data Coalition, Daniel Schuman, compared what was happening in Congress to a lobotomy, especially when huge steps have been taken to advance technology in the Executive Branch. And Zaleski sites a Sunlight Foundation finding that says only 15 percent of congressional websites are ready for HTTPS.



It turns out Americans dont want to share power drills, writes Sarah Kessler for Fast Company. The power drill was briefly the universally cited mascot of the sharing economy (everyone owns one but nobody uses it more than 15 minutes), but the platform(s) that would allow you to share small household items never took off, or folded completely. Kessler dives into why that is, finding that there really wasnt much demand for sharing services (one co-founder of a sharing platform could not get THREE usersof the thousands who registeredto complete a transaction).
Reading now (you know what they say about hindsight) it seems obviously incongruous to talk about charging people for participating in the sharing economy. It just sounds like renting (and Kessler does point out that the most successful sharing companies are those that track most closely with traditional companies like hotels, car rental services, or taxis). From personal experience, I think that a post on Facebook would likely turn up a power drill available to borrowno middle man required.

This is civic tech: Civic Tech USC, a project of the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Society, has released a findings reports on Empowering the Public Through Open Data focused on Los Angeles Countys 88 cities. Among their findings:


Since 2013, 18 cities within the county have launched some form of open data initiative.


Lack of funding remains a major barrier to many cities involvement in launching open data portals, along with a need for more expertise and buy-in from city departments.


There should be mechanisms for regularly tracking and publicizing stories of how open data is creating value, which can both increase public engagement with city data and help to make a case for meaningful ROI.




Related: Mark Headd responds to Technical.ly Phillys report on the liberation of the citys property database, arguing that the end goal of open data programs should be more than just producing more open data. He writes: The end game on open data has always been about something larger than simply filling up an open data catalogopen data is a pathway to creating a new way of operating in government.

This is civic tech: Heat Seek NYCs executive director Noelle Francois (a member of Civic Hall) has a guest post up on the National Low Income Housing Coalitions website explaining how she and her team are helping tenants level the playing field when it comes to getting their landlords to fix the heat in their buildings. She writes:

Our web-connected temperature sensorsessentially a thermometer connected to the internetprovide reliable, objective data to let everyone know when the indoor temperature dips below the legal limit. They automate the data collection process by taking a temperature reading once an hour, storing and analyzing the data on our servers, and calculating exactly when buildings are in violation of NYC housing code. Through our web app, tenants can log in to view their data and download heat logs. Our sensors are a simple, inexpensive solution to a widespread problem.


The Citymapper team, which has won open data competitions around the world for its urban transport apps, shares some really cool examples of how it is meeting the challenges of mapping cities where transport data doesnt exist, such as the informal transportation networks of Mexico City and, most recently, the completely undocumented systems of Istanbul.

When an individual applies for a loan, the lender examines the credit ratings of members of the individuals social network who are connected to the individual through authorized nodes. If the average credit rating of these members is at least a minimum credit score, the lender continues to process the loan application. Otherwise, the loan application is rejected.
    From Cagle: In short: You could be denied a loan simply because your friends have defaulted on theirs. Its the kind of digital redlining that critics of big data collection have been warning of for years. It could make Facebook a lot of money, and it could make the Web even less safe for poor people.

Blasts from the past: The State Department has posted a whole batch of Hillary Clintons emails (4,368 in all) in searchable format, though the Wall Street Journals tool works a bit better. Some fascinating finds to those of us with an interest in Clintons policies on Internet freedom:



Clintons December 29, 2009 response to her staffs first draft of her 2010 internet freedom speech: This looks fine and makes me sound like a techie (which is good, albeit a stretch.)



A January 25, 2010 email from Anne-Marie Slaughter, Clintons top policy advisor in 2010, sharing the news that a Chinese blogger said Clintons speech on internet freedom was like a song to his heart. Clinton replies, That is so gratifying!



Clinton counsel Cheryl Mills forwarding her a September 24, 2010 email from Alec Ross, a top deputy who was working on the Internet freedom agenda, describing the 1st known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria. (Ross also reflects on his and Jared Cohens high-profile trip there in June 2010, writing When Jared and I went to Syria, it was because we knew Syrian society was growing increasingly young...and digital and that this was going to create disruptions in society that we could potential [sic] harness for our purposes.)



Clinton responds to a Roger Cohen New York Times op-ed praising the good works of the U.S. Foreign Service, which had its internal communications exposed by Wikileaks in the fall of 2010, with two words: Not bad.



A November 24, 2010 email from New York Times reporter Scott Shane to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley reading, In view of wires, etc, and not for attribution please, we dont think WL [Wikileaks] is going to dump 250k cables on the web anytime soon. We think they will for now follow guidance of other publications and the initial numbers will be small. But multiple people seem to have the whole collection, so who knows. Crowley forwards the email up the chain, with the comment, Potentially great news.




You can download all the Clinton emails from here.

Here are some examples of Bridge translations coming out of the #YouStink protests currently underway in Lebanon.


Christopher Moraff reports for NextCity on pilot program in Chicago called RespectStat that rates civilian encounters with the police based on indicators such as an officers level of respect, helpfulness and competence, providing the citys police department with current information on varying levels of community attitudes towards the police.


U.S. Open Datas Waldo Jaquith is joining the Sunlight Foundation as a part-time senior technology adviser. Congrats!

Food for thought: On the tenth anniversary of Katrina, veteran reporter Michael Grunwald offers this Twitter-storm-rant on the ongoing scandal that is the Army Corps of Engineers. In theory, what the Corps does is old-fashioned civic tech, in the core sense of using technology for the common good, but as Grunwald points out, not only did 1,800 people die in New Orleans because the Corps flood protection failed, Congress never took steps to reform it after Katrina and the agency remains a prime hub for pork-barrel waste.


Our global town square: Data scientist Kalev Leetaru took a hard look at three years worth of Twitter messages from 2012 to 2014, and finds that if Twitter is indeed a global town square, its one that most of the town hasnt entered yetand one where the townsfolk who have entered seem to be doing more listening than talking these days....rather than growing outwardly and spreading to new regions, Twitter is largely growing inwardly and intensifying its coverage of locations where it was already popular, including the United States, Indonesia, and Japan.


Twitter has published explicit targets for improving the diversity of its workforce in 2016, Stuart Dredge reports for The Guardian.


EFFs Parker Higgins points out that a big reason Russia backed down on censoring Wikipedia last week over the publication of an article about hashish (which apparently violated the countrys restrictions on content related to drugs) was because the site uses HTTPS encryption. As a result, Russian authorities could not avoid blocking the entire site when they sought to suppress that one page. Higgins argues that that level of conspicuous overblocking was too much censorship for Russian authorities to risk.


Google could face a fine of as much as $1.4 billion if Indian authorities decide it has been rigged search results in its favor there, Abhimanyu Ghoshal reports for The Next Web.


What political nerds dont get about techies: Since David Roberts long piece in Vox about how smart tech nerds dont get American politics seems to have struck a nerve, let me add a few cents about why Im not enamored of his essay. The core problem is that Roberts makes a blanket statement about tech nerds that he never actually backs up. Tim Urban, the author of the Wait But Why blog, is his sole target, and that for writing a long post about climate change that gets the science right and the politics wrong. From there, Roberts leaps, gazelle-like, to the claim that distaste for government and politics is extremely common in the nerd community and that most tech nerds just think Washington is dysfunctional and both parties are equally to blame. Well, if tech nerds all thought that, then why are so many tech nerds plugged into the Obama administration (and campaign before it)? And why are Democratic campaigns so well stocked with tech nerds while the Republicans struggle to recruit top talent to their side?


(Oh, and as to Roberts claim that there are no independents in American politics, the fact is that when Americans have three viable choices on the ballot (rather than the duopoly), they often vote for the independentjust ask Senators Angus King, Bernie Sanders, Lincoln Chafee or Governors Bill Walker, Lowell Weicker and Jesse Ventura. If Democratic and Republican party identities were so strong, how did these guys all get elected?)

Yesterday a Periscope livestream of a sit-in let by House Democrats to try to force a vote on gun control was broadcast live on C-SPAN because technically*technically*the House was declared in recess by Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) and the C-SPAN cameras were turned off, Sophie Kleeman reports for Gizmodo. It is the House, and not the network, that controls the cameras. A C-SPAN spokesperson said it was the networks first extended periscope broadcast.


The protest went into the early hours of the morning, David Herszenhorn and Emmarie Huetteman report for the New York Times.


People following along at home began tweeting with the hashtag #Ham4SitIn, altering Hamilton lyrics to fit the situation.

Gawkers Alex Pareene explains why this particular bit of political theater is a tremendous waste of popular support and activist energy in support of a measure that isnt just ineffective but also actively offensive because it would do little to stem gun violence and would increase surveillance of a particular group of people.


Arizona Senator John McCain has filed an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act that would allow the FBI to access internet browsing histories and email metadata without a warrant, Tess Owen reports for Vice News.


Elizabeth Warren wrote a letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in support of stronger privacy standards for broadband internet service that would prevent internet providers from charging customers extra to maintain their privacy, which is already a standard practice for some companies (cough AT&T).


What sharing economy? City representatives from New York, Paris, Seoul, Athens, Barcelona, and Toronto, among several others, have met to discuss unified policy response to sharing economy companies like Uber and Airbnbwhich so far have been stretching city laws to fit their needs one by one, Marie Maway, Helene Fouquet, and Henry Goldman report for Bloomberg.


Still staying in hotel rooms? A new app encourages travelers to take photos of their hotel rooms before unpack, to be uploaded into a database that will make it easier to law enforcement to identify rooms that have been used to hold trafficked minors, Nancy Cambria reports for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.


New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio will host a gathering on the subject in May 2017, Dana Rubinstein reports for Politico.


Leaked data from the on-demand car service Uber shows that drivers in Denver, Detroit, and Houston earned less than 13.25 an hour after expenses in 2015, a figure that punctures somewhat the companys position that it helps drivers achieve financial independence and the America Dream, Caroline ODonovan and Jeremy Singer-Vine report for BuzzFeed.


How not to tech: Ethan Zuckerman responds thoughtfully and at length to the cringe-worthy essay by Contently co-founder Shane Snow, How Soylent and Oculus Could Fix the Prison System or, the SoyOculus method. The whole thing is worth a read, but here are some choice excerpts:
In other words, when Snow focuses on making prison safer and cheaper, hes working on the wrong problem. Yes, prisons in the US could be safer and cheaper. But the larger problem is that the US incarcerates more people than any other nation on earth  with 5% of the worlds population, we are responsible for 25% of the worlds prisoners. Snow may see his ideas as radical and transformative, but theyre fundamentally conservative  he tinkers with the conditions of confinement without questioning whether incarceration is how our society should solve problems of crime and addiction. As a result, his solutions can only address a facet of the problem, not the deep structural issues that lead to the problem in the first place.
Perhaps isolation for years at a time, living vicariously through a VR headset while sipping an oat flour smoothie would be preferable to time in the prison yard, mess hall, workshop or classroom for Snow. But theres no indication that Snow has talked to any current or ex-offenders about their time in prison, and about the ways in which encounters with other prisoners led them to faith, to mentorship or to personal transformation. The people Shane imagines are so scary, so other, that he cant imagine interacting with them, learning from them, or anything but being violently assaulted by them. No wonder he doesnt bother to ask what aspects of prison life are most and least livable, which would benefit most from transformation.
It is unlikely that anyone is going to invite Shane Snow to redesign a major prison any time soon, so spending more than three thousand words urging you to reject his solution may be a waste of your time and mine. But the mistakes Shane makes are those that engineers make all the time when they turn their energy and creativity to solving pressing and persistent social problems. Looking closely at how Snows solutions fall short offers some hope for building better, fairer and saner solutions.

Hsu writes: We have come to accept the narrative linking the sixties to modern-day computingbut what happened to the promise of freedom that first animated the heads?

After Bernie: At The Peoples Summit in Chicago this weekend, progressives came together to discuss how to continue pushing for the changes they want to see after Bernie Sanders drops out of the race, Yamiche Alcindor reports for the New York Times. Alcindor interviewed a sampling of attendees about whether they would support Hillary Clintonor even support Bernie Sanders eventual endorsement of Clinton.

Politicos Darren Samuelsohn explains how Hillary Clinton is going to try to win over one of Bernie Sanders biggest fan bases, millennials, including hiring Sanders former youth-oriented staffers and using the same digital campaigning tools as Sanders campaign.

Its World Refugee Day, and over at Civicist weve just posted a write-up about the Personal Democracy Forum panel At the End of Every Data Point is a Human Being: The If and When of Technology for the Global Refugee Crisis by panelist Lina Srivastava.


What sharing economy? Has the Uber-for-X model gone the way of the dodo, or is it just growing up? Sarah Kessler investigates for Fast Company.


Participating in the world of sharing services often entails more risks for women and minorities, Sirin Kale writes for Broadly. The life-blood of the sharing economy is the idea that the public space is a safe space, wherein individuals can open up their homes to strangers and reap the financial and cultural dividends, Kale writes. Airbnbs mission statement talks of returning us to a place where everyone can feel they belong. It also describes the house as just as space. But for women and marginalized groups the world over, houses are much more than spaces: They are retreats, sanctuaries from a world where public space remains dangerous, contested territory.


Author Tom Slee weighed in, telling Kale: Its not really fashionable to be in favour of bureaucracy and rules, but equal pay for equal work, minimum wage laws, employment standards that limit employers right to fire at will, and anti-discrimination laws were the results of years of struggle by feminists, unionists, and anti-racism groups...I dont think they should be thrown away just because a new app has a rating system.


Although Airbnb head Brian Chesky has pledged to eliminate racism from the room/apartment-sharing platform, users must agree to waive their right to sue as part of a class-action lawsuit before signing up for the service. This has long been the case, but the terms of service were updated in March to highlight that particular clause, Katie Benner reports for the New York Times. The clause shields the company from the strong outside pressure to change that class-action lawsuits can bring, and allows Airbnb to address the issue in their own time.


And in related news, it will soon be illegal in New York to even advertise an entire apartment on short-term rental sites like Airbnb, Miranda Katz reports for Gothamist.

Writing for Civicist, An Xiao Mina looks at the role of video and livestreaming in grieving for the deaths and injuries in Orlando. It can be easy to ascribe these networked actions to the attention economy, a vain attempt to gain views and shares in the wake of tragedy in the news cycle. The fact that some of the videos received tens of thousands of views might be testament to this, Mina writes. But most received only a small handful of viewsthe spirit is in the sharing, not the view count; the gesture of outreach, not the uptick in stats. I am less worried about the social gains of people seeking affirmation in a time of vicarious trauma, retraumatization, and crisis; I am more worried about the easy availability of assault weapons, the erasure of LGBTQ identities except when politically convenient, and the filter bubbles that bias our understanding of what happened.

On the second day of the Personal Democracy Forum, Jason Mogus announced the release of a study co-written by Tom Liacas on how progressive advocacy campaigns succeed. We looked for innovation and best practices everywhere, Liacas and Mogus write in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. We reached beyond our ideological home turf to study campaigns on all sides of the political spectrum; we looked at groups like the Tea Party and corporate campaigns by Uber and Airbnb. We also examined the work of very large and conservative organizations such as the NRA, AARP and US Chamber of Commerce. Among their recommendations is opening up a campaign to allow for more grassroots power and building support within overlapping movements.

ABC7 Chicagos Ben Bradley covered Chi-Hack Nights work with recently released police video footage that captures various degrees of police misconduct ranging from scuffles to shootings. Chi-Hack Night volunteers are using the footage to make police violence heat maps and to flag problem officers, a task the Chicago Police Accountability Task Force report found the department wasnt doing on their own.


Rethinking debates: Christine Cupaiuolos latest round-up of debate news touches on the latest in Australian debates, how failing to participate in a debate cost Jamaicas former prime minister an election, whether or not third-party candidates should or will be allowed to participate in the U.S. presidential debates in the fall, and more.

Twitter has saved this Spanish town 13 percent ($380,000) of the annual budget every year since 2011, Mark Scott reports for the New York Times. More than half of the 3,500 residents have Twitter accounts and interact with town officials online almost daily. Read to appreciate the experiment in digital democracy, but try not to gag at the obelisk topped with a Twitter bird! I mean, reallyTwitters a tool not a god, people.

The floodgates for post-Bernie takes have opened. Writing in the New York Times, Emma Roller reports on more than a dozen conversations with Sanders supporters, including the former Occupy Wall Street activist Winnie Wong. This is a movement, Wong told Roller. It is not about Bernie Sanders. Hes a part of this movement. Many of the other supporters Roller spoke with said that, although they were not politically engaged before the Sanders campaign, that they will continue to be politically active in the future and maybe even run for office.


Between the AP proclamation and the Tuesday primary election results there was a Wikipedia skirmish over the meaning of presumptive and how might a statement on what will happen affect what does happen, expertly narrated by Sam Roudman at Vocativ.


The technology and privacy researcher Jacob Appelbaum resigned from his position at the Tor Project amid allegations of sexual and emotional abuse, Andy Greenberg reports for Wired. In a statement, Appelbaum denied the accusations of criminal sexual misconduct, and claimed they are part of a smear campaign. The journalist Quinn Norton attested on Twitter to hearing first-hand stories from people who said they had been harassed and threatened by Appelbaum, although she clarified that none of them, men or women, were sexual victims. Although most of the people who have come forward have remained anonymous, Nick Farr shared a story on Medium about Appelbaums verbal abuse and harassment, calling him an epic asshole, although, again, Appelbaum does not deny being an assholejust the criminal sexual misconduct.

Too radical for HBO: In a blog post published earlier this week, the Debt Collective condemned the HBO show starring John Oliver, Last Week Tonight, for their failure to credit the group for inspiring and helping to make the debt forgiveness stunt from Sundays episode a reality. At the last minute, the post reads, [researcher Charles] Wilson told us LWT did not want to associate themselves with the work of the Rolling Jubilee due to its roots in Occupy Wall Street. Instead John Oliver framed the debt buy as his idea: a giveaway to compete with Oprah. The lead researcher who worked on this segment invoked the cover of journalism to justify distancing themselves from our project.


A different kind of culture hacking: Lin-Manuel Miranda took to the pages of the New York Times to decry the bots that are coming between people and his musical, Hamilton, and to express support for stricter laws for knowingly reselling tickets procured with ticket bots.


Still havent bought your #PDF16 ticket? Online sales are closing at 3pm today. There will be a limited number of tickets available at the door, but maybe stop procrastinating already!

BuzzFeed has terminated an advertising deal with the Republican National Committee reportedly worth $1.3 million because they refuse to run Trump for President ads, Kyle Blaine reports for BuzzFeed. The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs, CEO Jonah Peretti wrote in an email to BuzzFeed staff Monday morning. He added, We certainly dont like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company. However, in some cases we must make business exceptions: we dont run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we wont accept Trump ads for the exact same reason.


Bernie Sanders text-heavy campaign has taken a serious physical toll on at least one Californian volunteer, Peter Dreier writes for the Huffington Post. After volunteering for the campaign for up to 10 hours a day for the past several weeks, 63-year-old Deborah Dentler woke in the wee hours of Saturday morning with an intense pain in her right arm. I guess my thumb couldnt take it all that texting and emailing, she told Deier. I was in so much pain my heart was pounding. She took the next two days off but said that if it hadnt subsided by Monday, the day before her state primary, shed volunteer through the pain anyway.

This isnt the way to make friends: An apartment complex in Salt Lake City recently tried to force tenants to like them on Facebook as part of an addenda to their contract, Karen Turner reports for the Washington Post. It also gave the complex permission to post photos of residents and visitors to the company Facebook page. The complex threatened tenants with a breach of contract if they failed to comply within five days. The effort backfired when residents complained about the requirement on Facebook and to a local tv station, and the page was taken down after being flooded with bad reviews and negative comments.


According to a new study by the Center for an Urban Future, participation in NYC public libraries technology training programs has risen 81 percent in just three years, I report for Civicist. The hope is that programs like this can reduce the tech talent gap in the city and diversity the tech sector, although the impact will be hard to gauge without knowing more about who is participating in the programs and whether or not the trainings help them secure employment. The demand is undeniable, however.


Automating government in India is reducing instances of low-level corruption, New America Foundation researchers Vishnnu Sridharan and Anjana Ravi write in Slate. Digitizing land records resulted in a massive drop in corruption for those who accessed the records at a computer kiosk; only 3 percent of those users reported paying a bribe, compared to the 66 percent of users who reported paying a bribe when accessing the information the old-fashioned way.


Cooper Fleishman and Anthony Smith report for Mic about the disturbing trend of identifying, tracking, and ultimately harassing Jews across the internet by encasing their names with three sets of parentheses. The harassment can escalate to death threats, images from the Holocaust, and home phone calls, and there has been a spike in anti-Semitic rhetoric online which many have tied to the rise of Trump. The use of punctuation marks to single out targets has made the trend difficult to track or filter in search queries, or to flag as a kind of hate speech. (h/t Emily Jacobi)


In a follow up piece, Fleishman and Smith report on a Google Chrome plugin that does the heavy lifting of identifying likely Jewish surnames with the three parentheses for you, although as of this morning the app appears to have been removed from the Google Chrome store.

Is civic technology the killer app for democracy? asks Lorelei Kelly in TechCrunch. At first, it seems like its not. The killer apps for the systems on which we rely daily wont be technical, they will be human, Kelly writes. The killer app for [the DC] Metro would have to get political leaders to look beyond their narrow, short-term interests and be willing to invest in modern public transportation for our national capital region. Boy, that would be some app! Whos building that?
But the solution isnt not-technical either, of course. It will be Americans working together to build a technology-enabled resilient democracyone that is inclusive, responsive, and successful in the Information Age.
Civic technology...might give Americans the chance to renew public life by making democracy more visible and intentional, Kelly writes.
So is civic tech the killer app for democracy? It might be! TBD.


This is civic tech: In France, a lawyer and an engineer launched an online platform to run an open primary to select a presidential candidate outside the party system, Federico Guerrini reports for Forbes. Called LaPrimaire.org, the site has already attracted 164 candidates and 26,000 voters since its launch in April.


A coalition of civil society groups have published a letter condemning the FBIs proposal to exempt its biometric database from the Privacy Act, Ava Kofman reports for The Intercept. If given an exemption, the public would be unable to identify or address inaccuracies in the database.


#AirbnbWhileBlack: Screenshots of a conversation between a racist Airbnb host and a black woman trying to book a room went viral this week. Airbnb removed the host, and a spokesperson told BuzzFeeds Caroline ODonovan, We were horrified when we read these messages. But its yet another instance of racial discrimination in a growing list, and the company is being pressured to respond.


In other Airbnb news, earlier this week they launched a webpage where neighbors can report disturbances at Airbnb listings in four categories: noise and parties; infringement upon common spaces; criminal activity; or general complaints, Casey Newton reports for The Verge.


Civic Halls Andrew Rasiej and Micah Sifry have joined the Free Law Founders coalition, which is working to transform U.S. legal and legislative processes in the digital age. New York City council member Ben Kallos, a founding member of the FLF coalition, thanked Micah and Andrew for leadership in using of technology to improve governance and convening thought leaders and makers for years.
Jonathan Askin, a professor at Brooklyn Law School said, they are two of the most recognized, trusted, and valued thought-leaders, advocates, and deployers of civic technology and other innovative tools designed to promote liberty, democracy, pluralism, government transparency, civic participation and inclusion.

This is community tech: I interview Civicists newest contributing editor, Daniel ONeilwho recently announced that he is leaving Smart Chicago to join the company working on vets.govabout his five years leading a civic/community tech organization, the meaning of community tech, and why the hack night model (among other civic tech trends) has run its course.


Tech and the presidentials: Trump recently told The Associated Press that he thinks the use of data in elections is overrated and that there will be limited data use in his camp, Thomas Beaumont reports for the AP. Trump lags far behind the Clinton campaign in its use of voter data, Thomas Beaumont writes, and may not be able to catch up in time. Turmoil in his team hasnt helped; Rick Wiley, a senior advisor who claimed Trump would have a state of the art campaign and would absolutely use data, which he also called invaluable, has left the campaign since making those comments.


For the LA Review of Books, Civicist contributing editor An Xiao Mina interviews Negar Mottahedeh about her recent book about the 2009 Iranian Presidential election and the role of social media in the Green Movement.


A new study by NewsWhip reveals that there has been a noticeable decline in engagement with non-video media content posted on Facebook over the past few months, Matthew Ingram reports for Fortune, a likely result of Facebooks push into the video and livestreaming space. The top 10 publishers have seen likes drop by 55 percent between July 2015 and April 2016, shares fall 57 percent, and comments plummet 64 percent. Many of those publishers are being paid by Facebook to produce live videos for the platform. I wonder how they feel about those deals now.


Civil society groups in the EU are up in arms over the European Commissions proposed link tax, also known as ancillary copyright, and are encouraging consumers to weigh in on the issue before the EC closes the public comment period.

Rethinking income: Y Combinator has hired a research director to lead their Basic Income Project, Sam Altman, Matt Krisiloff, and the new research director, Elizabeth Rhodes, write in the Y Combinator blog. They also announced their intention to run a short-term pilot in Oakland before trying out a long-term project.


Motherboards Jason Koebler followed up with Y Combinator and found that the tentative plan is to give 100 Oakland residents somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 a month for six months to a year.

The Sunlight Foundations Alex Howard offers a dispassionate take on the Hillary Clinton email mess:
Regardless of what the FBI finds, we now know more about how a major federal agency failed to prevent an ongoing shadow system for communication from its head. As Clinton has acknowledged, she and her staff should never have set up this system nor should the agency have tolerated the arrangement. Conducting public business on a private server that was not properly secured, without ongoing testing, and proactive archiving with department staff was at best a bad decision. At worst, it represented a deliberate choice that avoided transparency and risked the security of sensitive materials.

Welcome to the alt-right, a corner of the pro-Trump internet where young would-be conservatives are getting the message that to fight for free speech is to tweet anti-Semitic memes at Jewish writers, and to make casual jokes to them about the Holocaust, as Jesse Singal reports for New York Magazine.

This year, white nationalists can barely contain their excitement over the presumptive Republican nominee, writes Buzzfeeds Rosie Gray, reporting from the annual American Renaissance conference in Tennessee. While there, she encountered the alt-right in person, writing. The alt-right like to flatter themselves that they are simply an ultra-ironic, boundary-smashing, fun-loving group of shitlords who might send a few Jews some mean tweets about gas chambers, then roll their eyes at all these cucks alleging anti-Semitism.

This explains a lot: Donald Trump has gotten a huge share of the media attention going to the presidential candidates, worth an estimated $1.9 billion in free media. But according to an analysis by Parse.ly of more than one billion page views across more than 100,000 articles, Hillary Clinton actually gets more page views per article than Trump. As Parse.lys Conrad Lee writes, while journalists seem to be preoccupied with covering Trump, the public is not especially interested in reading about him. So why all the extra coverage of Trump? Because he makes it so easy, says Lee: in the midst of todays 24-7 news cycle, most journalists can devote only a small amount of time to their next article, and so they often find themselves choosing topics that are convenient to write about. Trumps constant provocations via social media are perfectly tuned to this dynamic.

More data: Bookings at Trump Hotels are down compared to last year, says HipMunks Kelly Soderlund.

Tech and politics: The State Departments inspector general has issued an 83-page report that is very critical of Hillary Clintons email practices while secretary of state, Rosalind Helderman and Tom Hamburger report for The Washington Post.

Politicos Josh Gerstein, who has done the best sustained reporting on the Clinton email mess, points out that the official report flatly rejects one of her core defenses in the controversythat she was playing by the rules.

Three-quarters of the federal governments $80 billion tech budget is spent maintaining museum-ready computer systems, the APs Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar reports, citing a new GAO report to Congress.

Philip Bump of the Washington Post points out that theres a connection between Clintons private email server and the governments out-of-date technology. Which is true, but not an excuse for her decision to skirt the State Departments systems, he notes.

Damn you, auto-complete! Politicos Kenneth Vogel and Marc Caputo report that the Donald Trump campaign is seeking the help of the Republican National Committee to work up information on HRC/Whitewater as soon as possible. How do they know? Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks accidentally copied Caputo on the correspondence (she meant to be replying to a Trump campaign adviser named Michael Caputo).

Helaine Olen explains in Slate why robocalls are out of control, a dozen years after the launch of the federal Do Not Call Registry. The reason, she says, isnt that the government program isnt being enforced; its that the telcos arent giving their customers free and easy access to technology that would block the annoying calls. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) has a bill called the Repeated Objectionable Bothering of Consumers on Phones Act (the RoboCop Act) that would fix that problem.

Anti-abortion groups are using mobile geo-fencing to micro-target messages at women visiting abortion clinics, Sharon Coutts reports for Rewire. The groups can also use the same method to obtain the names and addresses seeking care at those clinics.

Life after Facebookistan: Randy Zuckerberg, sister of Mark, takes to the pages of Vogue to explain why the tech scene in New York City, her home town, is better than the one she left in Silicon Valley. Heres a smidge:

This multiplicity of interests also means that content is more highly valued; it is not merely a platform, whose success is measured in number of users, minutes of engagement, and daily actives. In New York, quality is more important than sheer volume; having your own voice is prized over letting just anybody upload their creations.

Was progressive think-tank Demos right to fire poverty policy blogger Matt Bruenig Friday for his use of inappropriate and bullying language on his Twitter account? If you must read one piece about the Twitter war that broke out over the last few days, involving Bruenig, Center for American Progress head Neera Tanden, Nation writer Joan Walsh, and a horde of Twitter trolls, make it Matthew Yglesias report for Vox. He does a good job of explaining the explosive undercurrents of the conflict, though in my humble opinion he understates the obnoxiousness of Bruenigs online persona, which culminated in his calling Tanden a scumbag.


Heres Demos communications director Liz Flowers explaining the think-tanks decision to part ways with Bruenig. Even if your organization doesnt have or think it needs a social media policy, this is a cautionary tale for the age of Twitter-fueled flame wars.


Theres evidence that trolls from the depths of 4chan are also having a field day playing Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters off each other.


Life in Facebookistan: The New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg takes Facebook to task for failing to be transparent about how its algorithm decides what is news. Since Ive been on this hobby horse for a long time, lets just try a counter-factual. Is the New York Times transparent enough about how it decides what is news? (I for one would like to know how its editors decided that the right way to refer to Donald Trumps racism was to call it a reductive approach to ethnicity.)


Tech and politics: The Bernie Sanders campaign built this microsite to tout its record-breaking small-donor fundraising: More than 2.4 million individual donors have made more than 7.6 million contributions totaling $212 million through April 30.


Speaking of money in politics, ExploreCampaignFinance.com, the passion project built by programmer Solomon Kahn via a Kickstarter, has just launched. The site offers beautiful visualization by sector and allows you to drill down into every single donation made to a politician or PAC, and invites users to submit their findings to politicians pages.

It helped to be in a high-tech studio built by McLaren called the Thought Leadership Centre. If James Bond called a meeting, it would be held here, she notes.


Crypto-wars, continued: Critics of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden regularly argue that he should have tried to blow the whistle using internal channels, but as this report in The Guardian by Mark Hertsgaard shows, an earlier whistleblower who did just that, Thomas Drake, was hounded by NSA insiders for trying to do the right thing. Hertsgaards story is based on a new whistleblower, John Crane, a senior Pentagon official who says his colleagues repeatedly broke the law in order to persecute Drake.


Digital divide: Four out of ten Detroiters lack broadband, which means they face a steep climb as they seek jobs and education, as Cecila Kang reports for the New York Times.

Life in Facebookistan: Microsoft researcher Tarleton Gillespie offers a near-exhaustive list of all the human decisions that go into the algorithms that make up Facebooks Trending Topics.


Conservative commentator Glenn Beck, one of several prominent right-wingers that met with Facebook brass Wednesday, writes on Medium that he was more upset with the behavior of his compatriots at that meeting than with company executives. He writes, in my opinion, there is no evidence of a top-down initiative [by Facebook management] to silence conservative voices. He also notes his consternation to hear fellow conservatives asking the company for what he calls affirmative action for conservatives.


In my opinion, conservatives upset with reports that Facebook may have been politically editing its Trending Topics have a deeper problem: the sites American user base tilts urban, young and female. So even if the site treated all content equally, it would tend to surface and highlight content that is more likely to engage urban, young and female Americans.


California saw a two-day jump of 200,000 new online voter registrations after Facebook posted a reminder to its California users at the tops of their news feeds this past Monday, the secretary of states office announced.

Americans are far more aware of the regulatory debate surrounding ride-hailing services than the one around home-sharing services, according to a new Pew Research poll out today. The poll shows that 72 percent of Americans say they have used a shared, collaborative or on-demand online service, although broadly defined this includes buying second-hand online, choosing same-day delivery, buying tickets from an online reseller, or working in a shared office space.


Speaking of the ride-hailing regulatory debate, Douglas OConnor, the key plaintiff in the recently-settled class-action lawsuit against Uber, has filed an objection to the settlement claiming he was left out of the mediation process and pressured into accepting, Caroline ODonovan reports for BuzzFeed.


New York City is testing a new way of building websites: rolling new features out slowly and asking for feedback along the way. Yesterday they launched alpha.nyc.gov, which right now only covers the three of the most popular website searches: Find a Job, Pay a Parking Ticket, and Get an IDNYC.

There are two camps of tech-and-social-impact groups, Tom Steinberg writes in his latest Civicist piece: those that promote the public good through innovation and digital technologies, or promoters, and those that try to reduce the harmful impact of new technologies, or mitigators. Although they rose in tandem over the past two decades, Steinberg argues that in our post-Snowden, drone-filled world, the mitigators have all the momentum while the promoters lose steam.


In a world where digital technology reigns supreme, freedom of speech should not depend on the whims of a few powerful corporations and government rules, Dan Gillmor writes in Civicist. Increasingly, it does. With his mitigator cap firmly on, Gillmor argues that the centralization of internet powers is the biggest threat to the internetto progress evenand calls upon government, foundations, and individuals to fight it: Government, to promote better policies that encourage decentralization; foundations, to address market failures that threaten the common good; and individuals, to invest in solutions if theyre wealthy, or to change their habits if they arent.


Gillmor singles out Facebook as one of the worst of the centralizers, but his disgust for the platform is nothing compared that of internet activist Hossein Derakhshan (who spend six years in an Iranian prison for said activism), who wrote for the International Business Times last week that, contrary to Zuckerbergs preferred narrative that Facebook connecting us all, it has in reality destroyed the open web. Not only does Facebook prioritise native content in its newsfeeds, but it is introducing ideas such as Instant Articles or Live to bring all the content scattered around on distant corners of the web onto its own platform. Zuckerbergs vision is not to connect people in distant islands, but to bring everyone onto a big island so nobody would ever need to use a bridge to go anywhere else, Derakhshan writes. For me, as someone who spent six years in prison at a time when being online was a serious and intellectual activity, it is heart-breaking to see how Facebook has changed the internet into little more than a portal for entertainment.


Threats as far as the eye can see: Manuel Ortega argues for El Correo de las Indias that the block that the blockchain threatens the distributed future of the internet.


Glenn Greenwald writes that The Intercept is broadening access to the Snowden archive, first by gradually publishing nearly a decade of internal NSA newsletters, starting with those from 2003, and second, by making the full archive of materials available to outside journalists, including foreign journalists.

Its the most open and honest response I have received from any New York City agency to date, writes I Quant NYs Ben Wellington, of the NYPDs response to his data analysis showing that they had regularly ticketed legal parking spots across the city to the tune of $1.7 million a year. THIS is what the future of government could look like one day. THIS is what Open Data is all about, Wellington writes, optimistically (might be harder to see it that way if you drive a car in the city and have received one of these erroneous tickets). Imagine a city where all agencies embrace this sort of analysis instead of deflect and hide from it.
Democracies provide pathways for government to learn from their citizens, Wellington continues. Open data makes those pathways so much more powerful. In this case, the NYPD acknowledged the mistake, is retraining its officers and is putting in monitoring to limit this type of erroneous ticketing from happening in the future. In doing so, they have shown that they are ready and willing to work with the people of the city. And what better gift can we get from Open Data than that.

Life in Facebookistan: Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-SD) has written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding answers to questions about how the companys Trending Topics feature is curated and asking for details about what steps the company is taking to investigate claims that it is subject to political manipulation.


Writing on his Facebook page, Harold Feld, the VP of Public Knowledge, drily commented, We will now savor the irony that conservatives who attacked Net Neutrality as the Fairness Doctrine for the Internet now want a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet. How can FB be censoring conservative perspectives when there is all that competition in the social media space? And wouldnt it be irrational and contrary to their economic interests to discriminate like that?


What Feld is actually saying is that, like Comcast or Verizon, Facebook is an internet monopolist, or close to one, and if you are concerned about its power to pick winners and losers or artificially create scarcities to charge rent for, or bias the news, you should be concerned about the big internet service providers too.


Those of us with long memories may find it ironic that Senator Thune is complaining about Facebook possibly biasing the news, considering that as a candidate for Senate back in 2004, his campaign paid several local conservative bloggers to inject a frenzy of dubious factoids and thinly-sourced opposition research into state media. As Jan Frel reported for PersonalDemocracy.com back then (yes kids, thats what we called it before techPresident or Civicist), these bloggerswhose payments from Thune were not disclosed until after the electionsuccessfully raised questions about the political leanings of the states main newspaper. Thune later bragged about how useful those biased bloggers were for his campaign; now as a Senator, of course, hes an enemy of media bias.


Conservative writer Katrina Trinko of The Daily Signal is angry that Facebook curators reportedly suppressed attention to topics like the controversy involving IRS official Lois Lerner, who was accused of inappropriately targeting conservative groups for audits.


Nilay Patel of The Verge helpfully points out that Facebooks Trending Topics box is hardly the most important driver of its users attentionthat would be its mobile News Feed, which doesnt include trending topics.


Kate Losse, the author of The Boy Kings, a really excellent memoir of her days at early Facebook, writes for Fusion that the real news curators at Facebook are the engineers who write its algorithms and who decided, say, that party photos of friends were of greater social importance than, say, religious texts. And given that the company refuses to be more transparent about the decisions baked into its news algorithms, she points out that we cant really evaluate the merit of its news judgments.

Great leaders tweet. Thats the kindest thing Jon Stewart had to say about Donald Trump, speaking at the Chicago Institute of Politics with David Axelrod. He also compares the heads of network news to crack dealers who are praising Trump as great for business.


Wait, theres more, very much on the topic of civic tech: At minute 37 in the Stewart video, he asks why, if the President can issue an order to kill an American citizen by drone missile, he cant issue an executive order to force the VA and DOD to reevaluate their computer systems so that you dont spend a billion dollars trying to get two computer programs to talk to each other, when probably three of these idiots [he points to the students in the audience] can do it for $500. He adds, that the failure to fix government opened the door for assholes like Trump. Democrats havent done enough to show that government can be effective for people and be efficient for peopleand if you cant do that, youve lost the right to make that change and someone is going to come in and demagogue you. Axelrod, who was a senior advisor to President Obama upon his entering office, blames bureaucracy piled on bureaucracy for the problem.

Under their leadership, Open Oakland spearheaded projects like OpenDisclosure, which turns campaign finance filings into easy-to-read and easy-to-search charts and maps, Parklandish, a (currently inactive) tool that helps people find public parking and public restrooms in Oakland, and Open Budget: Oakland, a web app for visualizing the city budget. Making OpenOakland a more formal, established organization would require, Tejeda said, very patient capital. Spiker added, We found it very difficult to find money that fit where we wanted to go and what we wanted to be.

Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and weve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible. At the same time, our reviewers actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.

This is civic tech: This morning, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled out the citys new Digital Playbook with an announcement event here at Civic Hall. Its goal is to improve constantly the delivery of City services, embrace government transparency, generate genuine civic engagement, and make New York the most user-friendly and innovative city in the world. The playbook calls for the development of accurate, responsive services, human-centered research, design and evaluation,seamless services across multiple agencies, a single sign-on experience for users, and the use of common data standards to make it easier for people to access, share, and build on the citys information.


This is another element of fighting inequality, de Blasio declared. To make more information available and to make more access to power available. We intend to be very focused in breaking down those barriers and opening things up....Its our obligation to be in a constant dialogue with our people. He called on the citys tech community to hold City Hall accountable to the promises in the playbook, and insisted that they were essential to his administrations efforts to improve housing, education and the like.


In addition to Jessica Singleton, the citys chief digital officer and Minerva Tantoco, the citys chief technology officer, de Blasio gave credit for the playbooks development to Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer and Councilman Ben Kallos for their ongoing efforts to make the city more digital.


Ironically, de Blasio was interviewed by new Uber board member Arianna Huffington, who took several opportunities to plug her current book project, the need to recharge and the value of getting 8 hours of sleepthings that techies tend to think about only in terms of lithium ion batteries and weeks, not days.


And despite his call to open things up and be in constant dialogue with our people, the Mayor and Huffington unfortunately had no time to take questions from the public during the launch event.


With the launch of the NYC Digital Services Playbook, technology, data, and design become the corner stone of a 21st century New York City, Noel Hidalgo, the Executive Director of BetaNYC commented, applauding the launch. BetaNYC is calling for the city to create a unified digital services department to insure that the principles laid out in the playbook actually get implemented.

Uber is also being sued in federal court by a local Austin activist for allegedly robo-texting thousands of Austinites as part of its campaign to get out the vote, Nolan Hicks reports for the Austin American-Statesman. (To prevent spam, it is illegal to mass-text message recipients.)


Crypto-wars, continued: Twitter is reportedly no longer allowing Dataminr to sell data services to U.S. intelligence agencies, according to the Wall Street Journal.

This literally is giving me goose-bumps: In the last day, Chinas Baidu.com search engine has unblocked results for tank man, our man in Shanghai, Clay Shirky, shares via Twitter. Many people dont get how successful the Party has been in putting the Tiananmen massacre in a memory hole. Showing the image is amazing, he adds. He estimates, at a conservative guess, thereve been a billion screenshots taken of various banned images, jokes and memes during the last day. As he explains, the government has been drastically tightening up its media control and for some reason Baidu executives are fighting back. This will not end well, Shirky notes.


Tech and politics: With Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders campaign starting to run out of steam, Jonathan Mahler and Nick Corasaniti report for the New York Times on where his online foot soldiers will turn. They quote some dude named Sifry who points out that its not an army, its a swarm, and warns that Hillary Clinton will have to win their support with honey, but if she tries to command them, theyll just sting her. As swarms may do.


Tucked deftly inside David Samuels long profile in the New York Times Magazine of Obama speechwriter and foreign policy guru Ben Rhodes is a valuable analysis of how the White House gets its message out in the age of digital media (and the collapse of foreign news bureaus). With the old-fashioned bully pulpit gone, David Axelrod, a longtime Obama confidant, tells Samuels: ...more and more, over the last couple of years, theres been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found. I think theyve approached these major foreign-policy challenges as campaign challenges, and theyve run campaigns, and those campaigns have been very sophisticated.


As a case in point, Samuels details the work that went into the digital campaign to sell the Iran deal, which literally included a Twitter account called @TheIranDeal. He writes, By applying 21st-century data and networking tools to the white-glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing onlineand make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet.


What if chat conversations become the new media? Thats the essence of this almost classically overheated profile of Silicon Valley start-up Sidewire, which managed to snag a long profile by David Lidsky in Fast Company. Sidewises founders are currently pegging their hopes on being the hot new political app of 2016 (nope, that was Meerkat), and the company has the requisite mix of former DC insiders hoping to get rich off that tech-politics thing and a 21-year-old co-founder who dropped out of Stanford and namedrops books like Godel, Escher, Bach. The funny thing about Sidewires main productthe ability to share 250-character comments in real-timeis that its tuned to meeting the needs of the same self-referential inside-the-Beltway group of DC villagers who now obsess over Twitter. But they get an extra 110 characters! Thats clearly something millions of Americans are begging for, since they cant chat with their friends at length anywhere else, right?


Why you should use encryption: Buried deep inside this mind-blowing expose by Troy LaRaviere, a Chicago elementary school principal, detailing yet more corruption in Rahm Emanuels Chicago, is this nugget: Chicago Public Schools bureaucrats apparently were monitoring his official school Gmail account to spot references to sensitive matters like a massive privatization contract with Aramark/Sodexo, companies making hundreds of millions of dollars handling what used to be public sector janitorial jobs in school. LaRaviere has been described as Emanuels biggest critic, and after you read his post, youll understand why.


This is civic tech: Our Jessica McKenzie reports on Zooniverses Project Builder, which she calls a WordPress for Plug-and-Play Citizen Science. (And I think of it as a virtual analog to that 3-D printer that can print more 3-D printers, only for crowdsourcing projects.)


The neighborhood-centric private social network NextDoor.com continues to stir up concerns that it intensifies the paranoia of affluent white communities about crime, as Kafeh Waddell reports for The Atlantic. This time the locus of controversy is Seattle, where the city police department is trying a variety of ways of improving public engagement, including social media.


Brave new world: Top White House officials Megan Smith, D.J. Patel, and Cecilia Munoz sum up a new Obama administration report on big data and civil rights, warning that The algorithmic systems that turn data into information are not infalliblethey rely on the imperfect inputs, logic, probability, and people who design them. Predictors of success can become barriers to entry; careful marketing can be rooted in stereotype. Without deliberate care, these innovations can easily hardwire discrimination, reinforce bias, and mask opportunity.


Trump watch: Writing for Vox, David Roberts makes a very smart and sobering point about the coming general election battle: the political industrial complex, and the media in particular, needs the race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to seem close, even if it is destined to be a blowout, because The machine is simply not built to handle a race thats over before its begun.

We are witnessing a compression of the working period in which bad policy shelters in the shadows, writes Edward Snowden in this essay for The Intercept on what it means to be a whistleblower. Daniel Ellsberg had to wait 40 years for Edward Snowden; Snowden only had to wait a few before someone else came forward with the documents that informed The Intercepts series The Drone Papers and a just-released book by Jeremy Scahill called The Assassination Complex. This compression, Snowden continues, ...permits the people of this country to learn about critical government actions, not as part of the historical record but in a way that allows direct action through votingin other words, in a way that empowers an informed citizenry to defend the democracy that state secrets are nominally intended to support. After pointing out that the government often releases information that is politically advantageous, even if it is harmful to national security, Snowden says, Truly unauthorized disclosures are necessarily an act of resistance.

Zero, and added that the company has a radical sensitivity to the suggestion.

Chicagos ambitious smart city initiative, known locally as the The Array of Things project, gets profiled in the Chicago Tribune by Kathy Bergen. And Daniel ONeil, head of the Smart Chicago Collaborative, explains why such data-driven initiatives have shortcomings: When I wake up and go outside, I dont see residents making a whole big fuss about enough civic data being released. Or hankering to know exact rainfall measures, block by block. Or demanding to see the exact nature of buried cable infrastructure. Instead, I see people shutting down Lake Shore Drive to demand justice for a police killing. I see protests of a Governor who cant lead, to devastating affect for poor people.


Washington D.C.s departing director of technology innovation Matt Bailey is heading to work for White House CIO on tech policy, but as he goes he shared these parting thoughts, as captured by Tasha Chappellet-Lanier for Technical.ly DC.


Crypto-wars, continued: Writing for Slate, veteran tech journalist Dan Gillmor points out that strong encryption will let venal politicians evade open government laws: What happens whennot ifthey take [their government emails] to Signal, a text-messaging and voice system that encrypts everything, or to PGP-encrypted email, where even if we get the records we wont be able to read them? But he still argues for strong crypto.


Tech and politics: The Republican convention is probably not going to use electronic balloting to certify its nominee, but as Darren Samuelsohn reports for Politico, officials are still considering it.


What sharing economy? Those new Uber for gas start-ups that will deliver fuel to your car while its parked? Local fire departments arent happy about them, and as Eric Newcomer reports for Bloomberg, in some cities like San Francisco, the companies are breaking the law.


Trump watch: In terms of our liberal democracy and constitutional order, Trump is an extinction-level event. Its long past time we started treating him as such. Thats how Andrew Sullivan ends his long meditation in New York Magazine on how democracies collapse into tyrannies. You may not accept every line of his argumentId quibble with how he describes the impact of Internet-powered organizing on democracy, for examplebut the whole thing is a must-read tour-de-force.


Note to readers: With Trump close to nailing down the GOP nomination and #NeverTrump voices in the Republican party starting to dissipate, its time we took the rise of Trump very seriously. Civic tech cant be neutral about a breakdown of democracy.

In just the past 16 years, Donald Trump has been sued 72 times in federal courtand those are just the ones against him personally, not one of his companies, Chris Dolmetsch, Sophia Pearson, and others report for Bloomberg.

This brings Mattern to civic engagement platforms. I think, surprise surprise, that she is too quick to dismiss them as superficial interventions at best or to ascribe them nefarious qualities at worst, but she raises some excellent points about who decides what these platforms do and how they do it. As it applies to Hudson Yards, she suggests that in such a meticulously planned community there is no space for co-designing with users or for meaningful citizen participation in creating the smart technologies that will define Hudson Yards.

We need a movement party thats decentralized, that many people can identify with, organizationally and individually, 350.org organizer Yong Jung Cho tells Rolling Stones Kate Aronoff for her story on the future of the Sanders revolutionwhich Aronoff says will include protests regardless of who wins the presidency, a side effect of the disillusionment that followed Obamas win. But beyond the next presidency, Cho and others want to see a new, open-source, progressive party. And, it seems as if a bit of the hope from eight years ago has returned. Occupy Wall Street veteran and Sanders organizer Winnie Wong tells Aronoff, The cynicism that came from the radical left when we first launched this campaign has dissipated...If anything, the radical left have learned a lot from him.

Radical: A group of Bernie volunteers and former staff have proposed to elect a brand new Congress, all in one fell swoop. Theyre pitching the idea to the Bernie movement and will then proceed to start recruiting candidatesproven servants to their communities, families, friends who have consistently passed on opportunities to sell outand then start campaigning across the country until the 2018 midterm election. Even if the replace-Congress concept is gimmicky, the idea of ramping up political engagement ahead of a non-presidential election is really interesting, and shows that progressive political organizers are learning from the mistakes of the past, when they let the air out of the movement after Obama took office and voter turnout at the midterms plummeted.


Civic tech must-read: Can the open data movement be said to have accomplished much of anything in the eight and a half years since the Open Data Principles were published? Thats the soul-searching question posed by Tom Steinberg in his latest for Civicist. His answer? Not much, no. Steinberg blames the movements failures on over-politeness, writing that meaningful transparency is only ever beaten out of governments with a stick made of pure power politics. Feisty! But also a must-read for open data advocates and supporters.


For Poynter, Al Tompkins has the backstory on how an investigation by Brian Collister and Joe Ellis revealed that Texas law enforcement officers were whitewashing their traffic stops by reporting Hispanic drivers as white.

Tech and politics: According to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), speaking at a Civic Hall Innovation Breakfast this morning, the most tech-savvy senator is his colleague Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO). He also disclosed that Tim Cook of Apple held a fundraiser for him last year in Palo Alto, which was highlighted by his pulling out his ancient flip-phone, to everyones amazement and amusement. The audience of tech entrepreneurs and civic activists applauded his support for net neutrality, along with his efforts to boost local tech start-ups like the Nerd Bus, which will connect the tech triangle in Brooklyn with neighborhoods in Williamsburg and the new Cornell Technion campus.


Asked by Errol Louis of NY1 for his position on the encryption debate roiling Washington, Schumer said theres got to be a way for both sides to sit down and come up with something. He warned that a terrorist attack could lead to a rush to legislate a crackdown on encryptions use, and called for more effort to find a technological or values-based compromise. There are many more discussions today between leaders of the FBI and national security and leaders of the tech industry [on this topic], he added.


Speaking of the U.S. Senate, Florida senate candidates Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) and Rep.

Todays tech and politics must-read: Dani McClain writing in The Nation on the distinction between social media savvy figureheads and the actual Black Lives Matter movement:
Twitter feeds constantly updated with smart observations about the latest cause for outrage are a lot more visible than the painstaking meetings that precede a transit-system shutdown, a citywide protest, or a collaboratively written 40-page policy agenda. But understanding the distinction between organizers and amplifiers matters; otherwise, well overrate those who excel at amplifying the passion of a movement and undervalue the organizers, who make concrete change happen.

Voting without illusions: On New Yorks primary night, Micah Sifry has this sobering essay on whats wrong with democracy, and in a word, its voting. Drawing in part on a new book by Roslyn Fuller, Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changes Its Meaning and Lost Its Purpose, Sifry shows how the system breaks down mathematically and, in both the States and in parliamentary systems in other countries, fails to fairly or accurately represent the people.


Dangerous incompetence: Thats what Sascha Meinrath argues in the Christian Science Monitor that the anti-encryption bill from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein is. If Burr-Feinstein passes, it guarantees that Americans will have worse encryption than the rest of the world, Meinrath writes, but he digs into past actions as well and concludes that their removal is actually the best way to ensure that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence stops endangering this country and gets back to doing its job.


What sharing economy?: Cathy ONeil, also known as mathbabe, reviewed Tom Slees new book about the sharing economy, Whats Yours is Mine, and found his arguments to be strong and a few sections, like the one on reputation systems and ratings, to be new and fresh even to seasoned sharing economy critics.


Gender parity: This is how NASA is getting more women to show up at their hackathons, Elizations Segran reports for Fast Company.


Writing on the Bloomberg Philanthropies blog to praise their investment in the What Works Cities initiative, executive director of Johns Hopkins University Center for Government Excellence Beth Blauer recalls first what it was like working in an information vacuum as a juvenile probation officer in D.C., deciding childrens fates based only on 30-minute interviews and police reports. But, when she lists some of the examples of data-driven governance in What Works Citiescitizen surveys in Kansas City inform decisions; using data to help programs produce more school aged children who are ready to learn in Las Vegas; and bold leadership powered by publicly available data in helping to secure neighborhoods in Jacksonnot a one sounds like it would impact juveniles caught up in the criminal justice system.


Open data could help solve the food crisis looming on the horizon, Rosemary Peters reports for Engineering and Technology Magazine.

What does 19th century food adulteration have to do with online harassment? Everything, argues J. Nathan Matias in this Guardian piece that outlines the history of food regulation in the wake of industrialization, and how people working to solve social problems online can learn from their fight against food adulteration. A big problem is that most ongoing research on harassment and comment moderation is happening out of sight: companies retain their research as a trade secret, and academics mostly publish in outlets with prohibitive paywalls. Like the Victorian food safety advocates that took matters into their own hands in the 19th century, public advocates for online safety will need, and have already begun, to compile research and solutions of their own, and put pressure on online companies to cooperate.


In response to reports of a $100,000-a-head fundraiser dinner for Hillary Clinton, hosted by George Clooney, Bernie Sanders supporters started organizing potluck dinners around the country to raise money for Bernie Sanders, with an oft-recommended donation of $27, writes Patty Jane on Medium.

This is civic tech: The head of the Washington, D.C., public library, Richard Reyes-Gavilan, is working on a renovation of its Martin Luther King Jr. central library that envisions a rooftop garden, two large performance areas, spaces for start-ups and students, an interactive childrens reading room, and a maker space called the Fab Lab. As Nevin Martell reports for the Washington Post, Reyes-Gavilan wants to put the D.C. Public Library at the forefront of American libraries, to be a model for the nation by embracing a hacker culture that treats library patrons not as passive consumers of information, but as creators. His mantra is libraries are not their buildings, but engines of human capital. (h/t Alex Howard)

Crypto-wars, continued: Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer explains why the company is suing the U.S. government to stop it from being gagged from telling its customers when their records are being accessed by law enforcement. He writes:
...we appreciate that there are times when secrecy around a government warrant is needed. This is the case, for example, when disclosure of the governments warrant would create a real risk of harm to another individual or when disclosure would allow people to destroy evidence and thwart an investigation. But based on the many secrecy orders we have received, we question whether these orders are grounded in specific facts that truly demand secrecy. To the contrary, it appears that the issuance of secrecy orders has become too routine. ...Over the past 18 months, the U.S. government has required that we maintain secrecy regarding 2,576 legal demands, effectively silencing Microsoft from speaking to customers about warrants or other legal process seeking their data. Notably and even surprisingly, 1,752 of these secrecy orders, or 68 percent of the total, contained no fixed end date at all. This means that we effectively are prohibited forever from telling our customers that the government has obtained their data.

Bookmark this one: Jane Wiseman, the head of the Institute for Excellence in Government, has written a long and well-thought-out essay for Harvards Data-Smart City Solutions on Customer-Driven Government. (h/t Heidi Sieck) As she writes:

Government Yelp pages are more common for agencies that directly serve the public on a one-to-one basis, such as departments of motor vehicles, post offices, libraries, courthouses, fire and police departments. Less common are Yelp pages for agencies without a public face, such as those that repair potholes, maintain public parks, regulate the timing of streetlights, or repair graffiti in public places. This is likely because these agencies typically dont think of themselves as customer-facing and are less likely to create a venue for online feedback. Wouldnt it be great if government sought out input on the quality of those services, and sought our input on how to improve them?

Whereas today there are many parts of the English countryside where there are more cameras than George Orwell could ever have imagined. So the situation in some cases is far worse already.

Access Denials: When did it become OK for a single cable channel to monopolize access to a presidential debate, Susan Crawford asks on Mediums Backchannel? Yet that is exactly what the Fox News Channel did with the first GOP debate earlier this month, with the result that if you didnt have a cable subscription, you couldnt watch. As Crawford correctly notes, There is no speech more central to civic life than a political debate. And yet we have allowed access to that speech by way of the common medium of our erahigh-speed internet accessto be controlled by a cabal of private actors.


This past weekend, Twitter informed the Open State Foundation that it was shutting down its Politwoops sites in 30 countries and its related Diplotwoops service, which monitored deleted tweets by diplomats and embassies. This follows on Twitters equally shameful decision to shut down the Sunlight Foundations Politwoops account tracking US politicians deleted tweets earlier this year. Explaining its decision, Twitter told the Open State Foundation that it believed all its users deserved the ability to safely and privately delete tweets. Arjan El Fassed, the director of the foundation commented: What elected politicians publicly say is a matter of public record. Even when tweets are deleted, its part of parliamentary history. These tweets were once posted and later deleted. What politicians say in public should be available to anyone. This is not about typos but it is a unique insight on how messages from elected politicians can change without notice.


In Wired, Klint Finley reports on how pro-government Twitter bots are disrupting online activism by Mexicos protest movements, drowning out real conversations with noise.


USA Todays Brad Heath reports on how police in Baltimore regularly use phone trackers (aka stingrays, or cell-site simulators) in everyday cases. He writes, Records show that the citys police used stingrays to catch everyone from killers to petty thieves, that the authorities regularly hid or obscured that surveillance once suspects got to court and that many of those they arrested were never prosecuted. State law requires that defense lawyers be told about electronic surveillance, while the FBI has asked police agencies to keep their use confidential.


Food for Thought: The Fall 2014 issue of the World Policy Journal is titled Connectivity, and this article by Egyptian political activist Mahmoud Salem, known on Twitter as @sandmonkey, captures well the upside and downside of connection technologies in revolutionary situations. On the one hand, he notes, a Twitter account called Tahrir Suppliescreated by two girls forbidden by their parents from attending the street protestscollected $700K in medical supplies in one day. On the other hand, he writes:

A revolution organized by social media is by definition a revolution made up of disparate individuals who share similar but general goals. When it came to details, however, the devil lay there smiling. Ideological disagreements reared their ugly heads. Political divisions cracked the collective. Shrillness and extremism quickly replaced rational discourse among even the most renowned activists, who had been allies for years.

Tech and the presidentials: Must-read: How Bernie Sanders supporters around the country are organizing themselves, frequently in advance of the campaign or with limited help from it, using Reddit, Facebook and clipboards, as reported by Ben Schreckinger for Politico.


One key Sanders supporter is Aidin King, a 23-year-old winery employee who administers the Bernie Sanders for President subreddit, which has 90,000 subscribers. (Notably, the Sanders campaign has made no moves to take over the Reddit pagethose of you with long memories will recall how the Obama campaigns online organizing team took over a supporters grassroots MySpace page back in 2007. One of the people responsible for that decision, Chris Hughes, is now the owner of The New Republic. The other one, Scott Goodstein, is working for the Sanders campaign.)


Related: On Facebook, Zack Exley shares that he joined the Bernie Sanders campaign six weeks ago, where he says hes doing the massively-scaled movement organizing work that Ive been dreaming about, and only scratching the surface of, for two decades. Exley was director of online communications and organizing on John Kerrys 2004 presidential campaign, and also co-founded and was the president of the New Organizing Institute.


Interviewed for a Time magazine cover story, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump (who is also self-organizing his campaign) says he would get rid of the artificial separation between Super PACs and candidates, arguing Now youre not supposed to talk, youre not supposed to  they go out and play golf, they get together, but they dont talk. Who believes that? So I want transparency. I dont mind the money coming in. Let it be transparent. Let them talk, but let there be total transparency.


Paging Larry Lessig: Trump also says this about Members of Congress and campaign finance:
All they do it fundraise. They dont really govern. They just fundraise. Their whole life is raising money. And I say what percentage of the time youre raising money as opposed to legislating? ...I mean theyre constantly  its that time of year, you come in. I mean thats all they do is raise money....Its the rare politician that can do whats right in the face of massive contributions.


And in a comment that is sure to interest companies like Apple, which have billions in profits parked overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes, Trump says, We should let them back in. Everybody. Even if you paid nothing it would be a good deal. Because theyll take that money then and use it for other things.


GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush says hes against encryption, reports Jenna McLaughlin for The Intercept. This is kind of like saying you are against math. The actual quote, from a South Carolina event sponsored by Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security, was If you create encryption, it makes it harder for the American government to do its job  while protecting civil liberties  to make sure that evildoers arent in our midst.


The New Yorkers Jeffrey Toobin makes a really good point about the latest twist in the Hillary Clinton email server brouhaha: the post-facto discovery that some of her emails might have contained classified information is largely meaningless, because government bureaucrats routinely classify far too much information and often do so for reasons have little to do with actual national security. And, as he notes, Criminal violations for mishandling classified information all have intent requirements; in other words, in order to be guilty of a crime, there must be evidence that Clinton knew that the information was classified and intentionally disclosed it to an unauthorized person. There is no evidence she did anything like that. This is not now a criminal matter, and there is no realistic possibility it will turn into one.


Future, Imperfect: Cosmopolitans Jill Filipovic reports on how Twitchy, a conservative online platform founding by rightwing blogger Michelle Malkin that monitors Twitter, has become an organized harassment tool. The site, which Malkin sold to Salem Media, gets 2 million unique visitors a month. She notes that Twitchys terms of use disallow content that is fraudulent, unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, offensive, pornographic, profane, sexually explicit or indecent, but those terms dont seem to be enforced.

Tech and the Presidentials: Just as the Obama campaign collected the mobile phone numbers of tens of thousands of supporters attending his mass rallies, candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are looking to the text message channel as the best way to communicate with their core supporters, Nick Corasaniti reports for The New York Times.


Politicos Annie Karni reports on concerns among Clinton allies that her response to the ongoing questions about her private email server is too legalistic.


Wondering why Donald Trump is doing so well in Republican primary polling? Political scientist Lee Drutman argues in Vox that its because hes in tune with a sizable chunk of the public: populists who want to reduce immigration AND protect Social Security, who may be as many as 40% of the overall electorate. What holds these two positions together is a turning inward mood led by Americans fearful that their middle class standard of living is disappearing. (Republican business elites who favor cutting Social Security while taking a more liberal view of immigration are deeply out of touch with their partys base, he adds.)


If you subtract Trumps demagoguery on immigration from the picture, hes somewhat more moderate than most of the other Republican contenders, Josh Barro argues for The Upshot. He cites Trumps statements and positions on taxes (he hasnt signed Grover Norquists pledge to never raise them) abortion (he favors allowing it in cases of rape or incest), and trade (hes not a free trader) as example.


My view: If Trump starts talking up his call to eliminate the inheritance tax in exchange for a one-time mega-tax on the mega-rich (14.25% on individuals and trusts worth $10 million or more), which he made in his 2000 book, The America We Deserve [h/t to Daily News columnist Errol Louis for the long memory], and keeps talking about how all the other top GOP candidates are too beholden to their billionaire Super PAC backers to call for anything similar, he could take the Republican base away from the party establishment entirely and win the GOP nomination. And if he fails at that goal, the Commission on Presidential Debates will be hard pressed to exclude him from the general election debates if he runs as an independent, since hes highly likely to be above 15% in the polls if he keeps campaigning.


All of the software that Lawrence Lessigs 2016 presidential campaign makes will be released under the GPL 3.0 open-source licence [sic], and all creative materials will be released under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 licence [sic], his exploratory committee announced. We have no idea why his organisation is honouring Her Majestys English.


Ross Choma reminds us in Mother Jones that most online political advertising is essentially unregulated compared to TV or print ads, where the names of the organization paying for them have to be disclosed.

Shes posted a modified version of her talk on Medium, entitled The end of the Internet dream. She warns: For better or for worse, weve prioritized things like security, online civility, user interface, and intellectual property interests above freedom and openness. The Internet is less open and more centralized. Its more regulated. And increasingly its less global, and more divided. These trends: centralization, regulation, and globalization are accelerating. And they will define the future of our communications network, unless something dramatic changes. (h/t David Isenberg)

Tech and the Presidentials: Welcome to the social media election, writes David McCabe for The Hill. Really? Does anyone have any evidence that shows that the presidential campaigns putting a lot of effort into their candidates social media postings are doing better than their less-savvy peers? McCabes examples include both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, who are doing better than expected in the polls, and Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Scott Walker, who are all doing as predicted or worse, despite their social media prowess.


Heres the video of Hillary Clintons August 11 meeting with five #BlackLivesMatter activists in New Hampshire last week, posted by GOOD Magazines Gabriel Reilich. The activists press Clinton on her support for the massive increase in tough on crime measures in the 1990s, championed by her husband while he was President. Interestingly, Clinton appears to admit that she is a sinner in the context of the rise of mass incarceration of black people. As MSNBCs Ari Melber tweeted, Candor & tension in Clinton-#BlackLivesMatter mtg shows why citizen Qs for pols are powerful.


Spending on online political ads is projected to top the $1 billion mark in the 2016 cycle, Jon Lafayette of Broadcasting & Cable reports. That would be a first, but at the same time most political dollars, $8.5 billion, will go to broadcast TV ads.

The winner of the Federal Trade Commissions Robocalls: Humanity Strikes Back civic hacking competition is a mobile app appropriately called RoboKiller, which uses audio-fingerprint technology to identify and block likely robocalls. As they explain on their Kickstarter page, Before a users phone rings, we trick robocallers to start playing their recorded messages so that we can start our analysis. Live callers hear traditional ringing during this process. If RAE [their rob analytics engine] determines that a call is from a robot, it never rings through; we send it straight to the users SpamBox in the RoboKiller app. Humans, on the other hand, ring through to the user as soon as their legitimacy is confirmed.

This is civic tech: Google engineer Carl Elkin used his 20% time to build Project Sunroof, which uses Google Earth mapping to help people figure out their homes solar energy potential. Its available in the San Francisco, Fresno and Boston areas now. As Elkin explains, the tool first figures out how much sunlight hits your rooftop throughout the year, taking into account factors like roof orientation, shade from trees and nearby buildings, and local weather patterns. You can also enter your typical electric bill amount to customize the results. The tool then combines all this information to estimate the amount you could potentially save with solar panels, and it can help connect you with local solar providers.

Everyone knows that Silicon Valley has made over San Francisco in its techno-utopian image, but Brett Scott writes in aeon that another victim of gentrification is the intangible thing one might called the hacker ethos:
The countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the preppy tech entrepreneur class. It began innocently, no doubt. The association of the hacker ethic with startups might have started with an authentic counter-cultural impulse on the part of outsider nerds tinkering away on websites. But, like all gentrification, the influx into the scene of successive waves of ever less disaffected individuals results in a growing emphasis on the unthreatening elements of hacking over the subversive ones.
    Although he focuses mostly on the debasement of hacker values for profit, its impossible not to also think of the state or business-sponsored hackathon, which focuses the techno-activists energy on sanctioned solutions to societys problems. However, hacker cultureunlike the physical spaces we normally think of when we say gentrificationis not a zero-sum game. While the language of the hacker might have been co-opted for profit, the true hacker spirit (whatever that may be) is still out there. As Scott writes:
Its in the emergent forms of peer production and DIY culture, in maker-spaces and urban farms. We see it in the expansion of open scenes, from open hardware to open biotech, and in the intrigue around 3D printers as a way to extend open-source designs into the realm of manufacture.


Related: In Kernel, an interview by Jesse Hicks with one of the authors of The Misfit Economy, Alexa Clay. Clay describes the book as basically a manifesto for people to really embrace their own inner misfit, their rogue or their counter-cultural personality. Hacking is featured prominently. Although she sings the praises of whistleblowers like Snowden or hacker collectives like UX in Paris, that operate outside of market forces, she concludes, I dont think the misfit economy is a blueprint for a new economy...but I think its really a set of skills for an economy in transition, which is where were at right now.

Yesterday was the anniversary of Michael Browns death in Ferguson, Missouri. In an op-ed for The Guardian, activist and organizer DeRay McKesson recalls the importance of Twitter and Instagram to the Movement for Black Lives:
If not for Twitter and Instagram, Missouri officials would have convinced you, one year ago, that we simply did not exist. Or that we were the aggressors, rather than the victims. That we, and not they, were the violent ones.
    But social media was our weapon against erasure. It is how many of us first became aware of the protests and how we learned where to go, or what to do when teargassed, or who to trust. We were able to both counter the narrative being spun by officials while connecting with each other in unprecedented ways. Many of us became friends digitally, first. And then we, the protestors, met in person.


After a day of protests, an 18-year-old man named Tyrone Harris was shot by police in Ferguson and is now in critical condition, Lisa Brown and Tim Bryant report for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. An activist and protestor named Tony Rice, who filmed the aftermath of the shooting, was arrested shortly after for refusing to move back, Jon Swaine reports for The Guardian.


Data scientist Samuel Sinyangwe built this Protester Progress timeline of events and milestones in the Movement for Black Lives since Michael Browns death last year.


Sinyangwe also tweeted 980 protests have happened since August 9th. There were 240 in 1965. With his sources.


Brigade has released a new version of their app that includes voter verification badges. As Alex Howard observes on Twitter, Voter verification is something politicians care about; keep an eye on this. 


Natasha Singer articulates for the New York Times what rubs her (and many others) the wrong way about the sharing economy. Ditto the peer economy, the people economy and the collaborative economy.


Meanwhile, in California, Sarah Jeong reports for Motherboard that Ubers defense for an employment lawsuit is that they actually empower their contractors.


I describe this office as the smallest state agency that actually does anything and leave the rest to peoples imagination, Robert Freeman, the executive director of the New York Committee on Open Government, says in an interview with ProPublica (transcript and audio).


Here is a browser extension that replaces political correctness with treating people with respect.

Although co-hosted by Facebook, last nights Republican debate was not easy to watch online last night unless you have a cable subscription, as Matt Novak outlined for Gizmodo. I, for example, briefly watched some guy on Meerkat watch the debate, holding up a whiteboard scorecard when one of the candidates scored a point.


Jennifer Stromer-Galley opines for Newsweek that the solicitation of audience participation in the debate via Facebook is sham democracy:
Tonight, Facebook and Fox News will again let the public pose questions to the presidential hopefuls. As in the 2008 YouTube debates, the public can post a video question to the Fox News Facebook page. Unlike in 2008, if the public visits the page, they cant view the questions submittedthey simply go into a black box.


Alex Howard tweeted that the integration with Facebook was often awkwardly phrased.


Last night, interest in Carly Fiorina, one of the Republicans left out of the mainstage debate, spiked, at least on Google search, surpassing Donald Trump.


BuzzFeed is producing slick and goofy videos for GOP presidential candidates, Brendan James reports for International Business Times. The question is, why? But by producing videos with candidates, James writes, all of them hungry for access to the younger audience roaming the internet, is BuzzFeed blurring the line between covering politics and dabbling in them?


Edward T. Walker comes out strongly against the Uber-ization of Activism in a opinion piece in the New York Times, arguing that Uber, among other companies, is weaponizing their apps for political gains. He concludes: 
Technology may be neutral, but grass roots should mean bottom up, not top down. The #blacklivesmatter movement is a genuine grass-roots civil rights campaign, mobilized through social media. So is the environmentalist Bill McKibbens 350.org, with its blend of online organizing, social media strategy and in-person campaigning around climate change. But Ubers corporate populism is not. We should learn to recognize the difference.


At the digital inclusion summit held at Civic Hall on Wednesday, New York City City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the Mozilla Foundation announced a joint program to increase digital literacy and civic engagement through technology initiatives, reports Gloria Pazmino for Capital New York.

ProPublica has always partnered with larger news organizations to get their public interest stories in front of as many eyes as possible, but yesterday they announced a partnership with Yelp. Scott Klein, ProPublicas assistant managing editor, said millions of Yelp users will also have access to the news organizations data, Lena H. Sun reports for the Washington Post. In return, the news organization will have bulk access to all of Yelps health-care reviews to use in research for news stories.

Tech and the presidentials: A Politico review of the 17 GOP candidates websites found almost half lacked an issue page, where they can outline their stances on things Americans care about, including Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. For the rest of the pack, Darren Samuelsohn writes, the policy pages of their websites are largely afterthoughts, light on significant detail.


The New York Times Ashley Parker has this glimpse into the Republicans social media-centered war rooms, writing that, in the battle for public opinion, the presidential debates will be won or lost on social media, possibly before the 10 Republican hopefuls have even answered the last question.

Our contributing editor An Xiao Mina has co-written a piece for Civicist with Julia Ticona on thinking past the digital divide. They find that thinking about internet access as a binaryyou have it or you dontmisses many of the ways Americans get online. That limited view could prevent the government from investing in short-term, inexpensive solutions that could be as or more impactful than simply expanding broadband access.


In the spring, I wrote about an experiment in participatory democracy in Provo, Utah, run entirely on Loomio and NationBuilder.

Tech and the presidentials: Heres Donald Trumps self-referential question to his fellow Republican presidential contenders, as posted in response to Facebooks call for questions for the candidates appearing in the first GOP debate this Thursday. If you look closely, youll see that the article he has printed out on his desk for reading is headlined, Donald Trump Winning Facebook by a Landslide.


This headline has more cliches per word than most: Exclusive: Republicans Launch Game-Changing Data Center That Will Forever Change Politics. The story, by Mark Fidelman in Forbes.com, isnt a scoop since people have been reporting on the GOPs Data Center for years. But it does share some new data about whats in Data Center, including the number of people in the national voter file that theyve matched with email addresses (22 million) and the number of micro targeting data points theyve amassed (7.7 billion).


Cryptowars, continued: Longtime British investigative journalist Duncan Campbell, author of much of the best reporting on Britains secret surveillance programs going back decades, reflects in The Intercept on how Edward Snowdens disclosures have not only affirmed his earlier work, but also how the debate over rampant government eavesdropping has finally shifted.


While the German authorities have backed off their threat to investigate two journalists who write for Netzpolitik.org, the countrys leading political and digital rights blog, people there are still angry that they were threatened with a treason charge for publishing reports on domestic surveillance, Melissa Eddy reports for the New York Times.


Government opening: Mike Bracken, the pathbreaking director of digital for the U.K. governments Cabinet Office, has announced that hes stepping down after five years in that position.


As Code for America founder Jennifer Pahlka blogs, Brackens impact on digital government was transformative. Not only did he lead a massive overhaul of service delivery in the U.K., his work inspired her and other counterparts in the United States and led directly to the launch of the U.S. Digital Service. As Pahlka writes, Now, a pilgrimage to the GDS that Mike and his team have built has become a rite of passage (and a shot of energy and inspiration) for every serious digital government reformer in city, state, and federal government in the U.S. and around the world. Each of us is hoping to learn from and borrow Mikes model and capture even a fraction of the teams success.


Everything Pahlka says about Brackens influence is true (and this great talk by him at PDF 2014 showcases his thinking). Id like to add one more personal comment, about his courage. When the gifted young coder and democracy activist Aaron Swartz took his life in January 2013, suffering under intense pressure from an over-zealous government prosecutor who thought his copying of academic journal articles was some kind of horrific crime, Bracken posted an eloquent tribute to Swartz (and an equally skilled British hacker, Chris Lightfoot, who was a pioneer of e-democracy at mySociety), titled Standing on the shoulders of giants, on Government Digital Services official blog. To my knowledge, not a single one of Brackens counterparts in the U.S. federal branch who work on open government did anything equivalent to mourn Swartzs untimely death.


Hidden pleasures: Melody Kramer has pulled together an impressive list of every hidden journalism-related social media group I could find.


The Datadrive.com is a crazy, funny satire of Facebook, made by Daniel Kolitz. Its premise: The year is 2016. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has absconded to parts unknown, making off with the data of Facebooks millions of users. Texas mattress mogul Buck Calhoun has purchased the gutted social network in a fire sale and has now launched a data drive to replenish its depleted stores of valuable personal information. Check it out during your lunch break.

Governmental disruption: Steven Levy reports for Mediums Backchannel on the rise of the U.S. Digital Service. Since USDS is already delivering measurable results for government IT development, heres the money quote, from its deputy director Haley van Dyck: Our institutional innovation strategy is, if we can prove our value over the next 18 months, we believe it will be asinine for the next administration to not continue to invest in this resource. She also adds, speaking of the services recruits from high-tech companies: about 66 percent of the people that came out for three months ended up going home, quitting their job and coming back full time. And its on the rise. I think its over 80 percent now.


Presidential disruption: Political scientist Lee Drutman of New America has a nifty suggestion for how to test presidential contenders worthiness for the White House. Instead of holding debates, have them handle a simulated crisis, like a terrorist attack or a bank failure. He writes, for the Washington Post, Film crews could record the entire simulation, then television producers could turn it into a reality-TV special. Make all the footage public, and journalists could comb through it and analyze who handled the situation best and why. Candidates could critique each others responses. Wed also learn about the quality of advice the candidates get.


Speaking of quality advisers, the Donald Trump campaign has fired a political consultant, Sam Nunberg, whose racist statements on Facebook were first uncovered by Hunter Walker of Business Insider.


Social disruption: Writing for Vox, Max Fisher takes note of the recent online campaign against American dentist Walter Palmer, who killed a beloved lion named Cecil, and argues that mob justice is not justice. Indeed, it looks like the human flesh search engines of China are now here.


Writing for the Atlantic, Rose Eveleth asks a really good question: Why Arent There More Women Futurists?


Speaking of the future, in China millions of young people are hooked on a realistic chatbot named Xiaoice, made by Microsoft, that has mined the Chinese internet for human conversations, John Markoff and Paul Mozur report for the New York Times. The program remembers details from previous exchanges with users, such as a breakup with a girlfriend or boyfriend, and asks in later conversations how the user is feeling.


Uber disruption? Cory Doctorow tweets from FOO Camp: Building a co-op Uber alternative that returned Ubers share of the $$ to riders/drivers is as hard as making Linux... and adds, Therefore, the existence of GNU/Linux proves that building a co-op, open alternative to Uber is eminently do-able.


One of Ubers top New York political consultants, Bradley Tusk, Mike Bloombergs former campaign manager, is starting Tusk Ventures, a political consulting firm geared toward helping start-ups work withand in some cases, beat backgovernment regulators, reports Dino Grandoni for the New York Times.


Ideological disruption: If youve ever wondered what exactly is so grating about the Aspen Ideas Festival and all the other happy chatter that warbles down from places like the Aspen Institute all summer long, read the text of a speech author Anand Giridharadas gave at the Aspen Institutes Action Forum last week. A tidbit:

The Aspen Consensus, in a nutshell, is this: the winners of our age must be challenged to do more good. But never, ever tell them to do less harm. The Aspen Consensus holds that capitalisms rough edges must be sanded and its surplus fruit shared, but the underlying system must never be questioned. The Aspen Consensus says, Give back, which is of course a compassionate and noble thing. But, amid the $20 million second homes and $4,000 parkas of Aspen, it is gauche to observe that giving back is also a Band-Aid that winners stick onto the system that has privileged them, in the conscious or subconscious hope that it will forestall major surgery to that systemsurgery that might threaten their privileges.


Civic disruption: Chicago has announced a new system using public data to prioritize inspections restaurants most likely to have health code problems, helping them resolve any issues as quickly as possible and prevent foodborne illnesses before they ever begin, according to a press release from Mayor Rahm Emanuels office. The system was created as party of a $1 million grant to Chicago from the Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge.

Cryptowars, continued: A coalition of privacy, civil liberties, and internet freedom groups have generated more than 6.1 million faxes to Members of Congress from internet users opposed to the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), Fight for the Future announced yesterday. (The faxes are being sent electronically, so no trees are being harmed in the process, FFTF says.)


On Medium, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) explains why CISA wont protect anyone from hackers.


Kate Kaye of AdAge reports on a House subcommittee hearing earlier this week on the Internet of Things that consisted entirely of representatives from industry groups, without even one privacy advocate. it comes as no surprise, she writes, that the general consensus among witnesses was that innovators should be free to innovate without the threat of overreaching privacy legislation getting in the way.


Tech and the presidentials: Classified emails on former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons private server had information from five U.S. intelligence agencies, Marisa Taylor, Greg Gordon, and Anita Kumar report for McClatchy DC.


The Clinton campaign is pretty upset at the New York Times for how it bungled its coverage of the non-criminal referral story last week, as this letter from its communications director Jennifer Palmieri to Times executive editor Dean Baquet shows.


Senator Bernie Sanders campaign says more than 100,000 supporters attended more than 3,500 house parties Wednesday night, all listening to the candidate via a video live-stream, Nick Corasaniti reports for the New York Times. Attendees at the house parties were asked to text a number to opt in and show interest, he notes.


Money talks: Former President Jimmy Carter tells talk radio host Thom Hartman that thanks to unlimited money in politics, America is just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president. And the same thing applies to governors and U.S. senators and congressmembers.


GenderAvengers: Ainsley OConnell reports for Fast Company on Quibb founder Sandi MacPhersons 50-50 pledge effort to get conference organizers to commit to equalize their numbers of male and female speakers.

Cryptowars, continued: Implicitly rebuking their current colleagues, three former top American national security officials, Mike McConnell, Michael Chertoff and William Lynn, write in the Washington Post in support of ubiquitous encryption at the device, server and enterprise level without building in means for government monitoring, saying this most serves the greater public good.


Annals of disruptive tech: In the Washington Post, the Fletcher Schools Bhaskar Chakravorti explains how Uber is navigating the challenge of winning the Chinese market. This paragraph is key: no prescription for success in the Chinese market can be complete without a plan for managing the true source of political power: the Chinese government. As protests by taxi drivers erupted in multiple cities across China, Uber recently acknowledged its commitment to maintain social order by using its GPS data to track drivers and their locations near protests and canceling their Uber contracts if they were near such protestsa strong signal to the government that its cache of data could be used for the social order maintaining objectives of the state.


Alex Rosenblat of the Data & Society Institute has a fascinating piece up on Motherboard detailing some of oddities of Ubers ecosystem, including phantom cars that a user often sees when they open the app (to entice them to think drivers are close by?), and the strategies drivers and passengers alike use to take advantage of (or avoid) surge pricing.


Baby you can drive my car: Andy Greenberg of Wired has another scoop on a security researcher who has figured out how to perform a man in the middle attack on GMs OnStar RemoteLink system, enabling him to track a target car, unlock it, trigger the horn and alarm and even start its engine. GM confirmed to Greenberg that it is working on a fix.


Tech and the presidentials: Ashley Parker reports for the New York Times on how Facebook has been working to expand its digital domination in the political realm. One critical innovation sure to be useful in 2016 allows a campaign to upload its voter filea list of those they hope will turn out to vote or can be persuaded to do sodirectly to Facebook, where it can target those users.


Government opening: The Library of Congress has added several useful new features to Congress.gov, including a tool that reads a bill summary out loud to a user and the ability to search within member profile and committee pages, librarian Robert Brammer blogs.


Open government groups in South Africa are challenging their countrys role in the international Open Government Partnership. In October, South Africa will become chair of the OGP, but civil society groups are facing increasing surveillance, intimidation and censorship of activists and the media, several leading organizations argue in an open letter.


Activistas: GenderAvenger is out with a new video (and mobile app) aimed at combating the all too frequent excuses conference and panel organizers give for failing to include meaningful numbers of women in their events. Heres a recent example of GenderAvenger engaging Launch Festival founder Jason Calacanis for only have 24 percent women at his March event. And heres a more promising interchange with John Koetsier of MobileBeat, who tells GenderAvenger Thanks for the eyes on it. Were trying, and yes, we still suck.

Petition 2.0: On first taking his job earlier this year, White House chief digital officer Jason Goldman said he would look into the backlog of unanswered WeThePeople e-petitions, and yesterday he produced results, Alex Howard reports for Huffington Post, announcing that from this point forward qualified petitions would get official answers within 60 days, and sharing responses for 20 long-unanswered petitions, including one from two years ago (!) calling for Edward Snowdens pardon (which was unsurprisingly rejected).


Heres Goldmans post on Medium (his former employer), explaining the updates to WeThePeople.


Writing for Civicist, Dave Karpf argues that the most important news here isnt the promise of a response within 60 days, its Change.orgs decision to partner with WeThePeople on petitions aimed at the administration. As he notes, most people sign one WeThePeople petition and never come back. Only two or three petitions are started per day on WeThePeople. Change.org receives hundreds per day. Not only does the partnership mean that Change and WeThePeople are no longer competing for users attention, Karpf adds, The more that WeThePeople integration is baked into the functionality of other large petition sites, the harder it will be for the next President to shutter WeThePeoples doors.


Writing for Politico, Sarah Wheaton puts the WeThePeople news in context of the White Houses longer up-and-down history of experimenting with and using digital tools. And she quotes some guy named Sifry who suggests that if Goldman and team really want to score some digital engagement points, they should try some more free-wheeling ideas, like a Wiki for suggestions about how Obama should spend his post-presidency, or a crowdsourcing site for pointing out government waste.


Tech and the presidentials: Sen. Rand Pauls campaign is struggling with deep fundraising and organizational problems, Alex Isenstadt reports for Politico. Among Pauls problems: he hasnt succeeded at cultivating a sugar daddy. Peter Thiel, the libertarian Silicon Valley VC, helped his fathers 2012 run, but Isenstadt says he is now unlikely to be a major contributor to the younger Paul. The senator also canceled a planned appearance at Auren Hoffmans Dialog Retreat, another opportunity to tap tech libertarian types.


Pauls digital director, Vincent Harris, went to Googles VidCon conference last week and came back convinced that his party is doing online video wrong. He writes on Medium, Republican campaigns, institutions, and advocacy groups are doing a great job of tv-ing the internet, while missing the key differences in the style, substance, and type of content that needs to be created for younger audiences.


In a new paper, They Dont Give a Damn About Governing, published by Harvards Shorenstein Center, journalist Jackie Calmes reports on how conservative media exerts enormous influence on the Republican party. For anyone wondering why Donald Trump is doing so well at the moment, Calmes paper is must-reading. Heres a taste of what she found:

Its not just talk radio, but the blogosphere, the internettheyre all intertwined now. Youve got this constant chorus of skepticism about anything the quote-unquote establishment does, said a longtime former top aide to House Republican leaders, Dave Schnittger. And, he said, the chorus is loudest in opposition to those actions that are fundamental to governing: meeting basic fiscal deadlines for funding the government and allowing it to borrow. Those are the things that leaders have to get done as part of governing, the Republican said, as much as conservative media may hate it.


And this:

Tom Latham, a longtime House Republican who retired in January, said, All the social media, Facebook, all this stuff has had a huge impact, in that theres a group of people out there for whom everything is immediate. It isnt necessarily verified as being true; theres a lot of opinion stated as fact. And they [conservative media] can arouse a lot of people just instantaneously. When Latham came to Congress with the big Republican class elected in 1994, We didnt have internet, didnt have that type of instantaneous communication, he said. Twenty years later, constituent contacts to his office went from maybe 7,000 a year up to, when I left, to 35,000 to 40,000 contacts a year, just because of the ease of communication and people popping off the emails every day. A lot of that is generated by the conservative talk show people and media people.


Calmes also made smart use of Media Clouds news search tool, finding a dramatic difference between conservative and liberal media in coverage of the Common Core education curriculum.


Annals of open government: Waldo Jaquith of U.S. Open Data explains how they created a simple, free, open source software product that will help states publish verifiable legal data, and thus are heading off a rising tendency to lock it up in the hard-to-access .pdf format in order to comply with the Uniform Electronic Legal Materials Act.


Future present: Frank Pasquale and Siva Vaidhyanathan, two of academias sharpest tech critics, write for The Guardian that when disruptive companies like Airbnb and Uber posture as righteous champions of freedom while they flout standing employment and anti-discrimination laws, they are actually invoking a different history: the choice by reactionary Southerners to nullify federal laws they didnt like. In doing so, they argue, these companies undermine local needs and effective governance.


Nick Grossman of Union Square Ventures, always a little ahead of the curve, says he sees the emergence of a whole swath of new networked services that will fill the gaps left by the unbundling of the job giving independent workers a variety of supports from help with job discovery and equipment to administrative help and insurance benefits.


Blockchain technology could be useful in protecting user-generated video of official misbehavior, distributing welfare payments, and providing people with official IDs, reports Emily Spaven of CoinDesk.


This is civic tech: Eilis ONeil reports for us on Civicist about the efforts of Black Girls Code, where girls learn not only how to code, but how not to feel like a weirdo for wanting to.

Here are five common-sense, bipartisan principles for building a smart, digital government, offered by Republican Matt Lira and Democrat Nick Sinai writing for Politico. As they note, The 2016 presidential candidates like to talk about innovation, and theyre currently debating the tech-fueled gig economy. Those are important issues, but when it comes to how government meets the digital world, theres a crucial component theyre not talking about. More like this, please.


Margaret Sullivan, the New York Times ombudswoman, retraces how the paper got the Hillary Clinton email criminal referral story wrong, blaming the rush to get a scoop and unreliable, anonymous sources.


Commenting on Sullivans story, Josh Marshall of TalkingPointsMemo zeroes in on Times executive editor Dean Baquets mea culpa. Baquet told Sullivan: You had the government confirming that it was a criminal referral. Im not sure what [the Times reporters and editors] could have done differently on that. Marshall responds, This is a telling statement. The government didnt tell the Times anything. Anonymous people in the government told them something. Big, big difference.


An unsigned editors note in todays Times effectively apologizes for not correcting the original Clinton criminal referral email story sooner.


Bernie Sanders campaign is planning to live-stream into several thousand house parties nationwide Wednesday night, and as Aaron Davis observes for the Washington Post, Whether Sanders can use the internet to build an effective campaign remains to be seen. Sanders told him he believes the event will be the largest digital organizing event in the history of this country, which may be true for a presidential campaign this early in the cycle. This map produced by the Sanders campaign shows 3,146 organizing meetings with 82,465 RSVPs. Looks to me like a pretty effective internet-driven campaign so far.


Tech billionaire loudmouth Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavericks, star of Shark Tank) takes a stand for his class, according to Fox & Friends, saying I have to honestly (say) he is probably the best thing to happen in a long long time. I dont care what his actual positions are. I dont care if he says the wrong thing. He says whats on his mind. He gives honest answers rather than prepared answers. This is more important than anything any candidate has done in years.


Heres a corollary to the Barbara Streisand Effect, which is what happens when you try to suppress something online: If, in the course of trying to intimidate a reporter from writing a damaging story about a past, reported event, such as Donald Trumps violation of his then-spouse Ivana Trump, your lawyer says, Im warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what Im going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting, then your lawyer actually has invoked the Streisand Effect.


Dave Pells Next Draft of the Future, written for Vices Motherboard, is wickedly good on current events, despite being written from the future.


Elizabeth Gillis reports for the Berkman Center blog on its Internet Monitor project, which is developing a new dashboard for understanding how people all over the world access and use the net.


Related: Vindu Goel reports for the New York Times on Facebooks efforts to sell its Internet.org project, describing it as an ambitious effort to connect the worlds poorest people to the internet, without mentioning that in fact it doesnt connect them to anything like the actual internet.


Writing for The Verge, Ariha Setalvad also describes Internet.orgs expansion as making it easier for any mobile operator to sign up to offer free internet access to basic online services, again failing to note that Internet.org does not provide users a connection to the open internet.


Julie Scelfo reports for the New York Times on how recent college suicides, often happening in clusters, may be in part a response to accentuated social pressure fed by social media. Describing one students descent, Scelfo writes, Friends lives, as told through selfies, showed them having more fun, making more friends and going to better parties. Even the meals they posted to Instagram looked more delicious.


The NSA will destroy the phone metadata it has been collecting on Americans since 2001, the APs Ken Delanian reports.


A group of leading artificial intelligence and robotics researchers, plus non-experts like Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Noam Chomsky, have signed onto an open letter calling for a ban on offensive autonomous weapons.


Josh Tauberer of GovTrack has launched a Kickstarter to hire a full-time researcher to add more information about the daily activities of Congress.


GovDelivery announced this morning that it has acquired Textizen, a product of Code for Americas inaugural incubator program that enables government agencies to communicate via mobile messaging with the public.


A new ranking of start-up ecosystems looking at the broad infrastructure of talent, knowledge, entrepreneurs, venture capital, and companies that make up a startup community has San Francisco first, New York City second, Los Angeles third, Boston fourth and Tel Aviv fifth, Richard Florida reports for CityLab. The global study did not include cities in China, Taiwan, Japan or South Korea due to language barriers.

With Donald Trump leading in polls of registered Republicans in Iowa and New Hampshire, GOP digital strategist Patrick Ruffini makes an important data point: the people surveyed by those polls bear little resemblance to the people most likely to show up to vote in those early states.


The New York Times has issued a correction for referring to a criminal referral regarding the use of Hillary Clintons personal email account while she was Secretary of State; now it says it was a security referral pertaining to the possible mishandling of classified information.


Former New York Times reporter Kurt Eichenwald takes to Newsweek to tear apart the Times first report on what he calls email-bogus-gate. He says the security issue isnt with Clintons handling of her email account, but with what FOIA officials reviewing what to release from that account have been doing.


Asked about the issue while campaigning in Iowa, Clinton said, I did not send nor receive anything that was classified at the time, Alana Wise of Reuters reports.


In the wake of Netroots Nation, Democracy for Actionthe million-member online organization founded by Howard Dean and run by his brother Jimhas decided to start asking all the candidates who want their support how they will stand with the Movement for Black Lives and what they will do to confront structural racism and our culture of white supremacy, their executive director Charles Chamberlain announced Friday.

Yesterday at a campaign event in New Hampshire, Republican Presidential candidate Jeb Bush rolled his eyes at the mention of the #BlackLivesMatter movement and Democratic candidate Martin OMalleys having apologized for saying white lives matter. Bush then commented, according to David Weigel reporting for the Washington Post, Were so uptight and so politically correct now that we apologize for saying lives matter? The video of Bushs comments was captured by trackers from American Bridge and quickly posted online. If you listen closely, Bush appears to accuse the #BlackLivesMatter movement of not believing that white lives matter.


Two inspectors general have recommended that the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into whether sensitive government information was mishandled by Hillary Clintons private email account while she was secretary of state, Michael Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo report for the New York Times.


In case you think this is a meaningful metric, A.J. Feather reports for Bloomberg News that Hillary Clinton is winning the Facebook primary in terms of how many unique people are talking about her compared to the other presidential candidates.


Josephine Wolff reports for The Atlantic on how the Secret Service monitors online threats to President Obama. She notes, Pulling up every tweet which uses the words Obama and assassinate takes mere seconds, and the Secret Service has tried to make it easier for people to draw threats to its attention by setting up its own Twitter handle, @secretservice, for users to report threatening messages to.


Heres a chapter and verse breakdown of how Uber steamrolled New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, from Dana Rubinstein and Laura Nahmias in Capital New York. Ubers use of its app platform may have gotten the most media attention, but clearly its lobbying army and full-court press on the city council did the trick.


The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken over a private website, FAFSA.com, which had been operated by a private company charging prospective students for help filling out their financial aid applications, something that directly contradicted the intent of FAFSA (the Free Application for Federal Student Aid), reports Alex Howard for Huffington Post. The site is being transferred to the Department of Education, he reports, as part of legal action against the private company, Student Financial Aid Services. This act of what Howard calls digital eminent domain may indeed be a first (pun intended, Alex?). Now, if only the Department of Education cared as much about helping indebted students with useful tech as it does about helping them get indebted, and didnt leave that job to volunteers. [CORRECTION: Howard has posted an update to his story: while Student Financial Aid Services does face legal action regarding overcharging and other issues, it voluntarily transferred the FAFSA.com domain. So, in essence, this wasnt an act of digital eminent domain, as intriguing a prospect as that may be.]

White House Presidential Innovation Fellow Denice Ross blogs on Medium about an amazing moment she witnessed during a three-day coding event where the New Orleans Police Department and the citys office of information technology and innovation released a preview of four city databases for a group of teenage coders and their mentors to build apps with. The event was part of the administrations Police Data Initiative which is working with 24 jurisdictions around the country to encourage better use of data to build community trust and reduce police violence.


As part of that initiative, data scientists are looking at how police departments can better use predictive analytics to figure out which of their officers may be more likely to overreact violently during stressful situations, Larry Greenemeier reports for Scientific American.


Reviewing data scientist Cathy ONeils provocative talk at Personal Democracy Forum this past June on Weapons of Math Destruction, political scientist and Civicist contributing editor Dave Karpf gently pushes back against her fear that political micro-targeting is bad for democracy. The tl/dr version: hes not very worried about it because campaigns have always targeted voters, now theyre getting a bit more efficient at it, and most potential abuses are likely to be caught before they do serious harm.


Wesley Lowery and David Weigel of the Washington Post report on Why Hillary Clinton and her rivals are struggling to grasp Black Lives Matter. They write: The strained interactions demonstrate the extent to which a vibrant new force on the left has disrupted traditional presidential politics, creating challenges for Democratic candidates who are facing intense pressure to put police brutality and other race-related issues on the front burner ahead of the 2016 election.

Yesterday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo added his voice to the Uber-NYC debate, calling for a delay in the city council vote on capping the growth of car-for-hire services. Uber is one of these great inventions, startups, of this new economy and its taking off like fire to dry grass and its giving people jobs, Cuomo said in a radio interview. I dont think the government should be in the business of restricting job growth.


Later in the day, the two sides came to an agreement: the de Blasio administration is abandoning its push for the Uber cap, and in exchange the company is giving the city a trove of internal data that it had been seeking for its congestion study, Matt Flegenheimer reports for the New York Times. Both sides are also stopping their war of words.


Related: Matt Stempeck has been tracking how corporations and tech companies in particular with big online platforms have used that leverage in political fights, and in this new piece for Civicist he reports on how Uber Pushes Corporative Activism in the Digital Age to the Next Level, raising important questions like In which instances do we applaud corporate intervention by user interface, and in which do we decry it? How aggressive a campaign should a publicly traded company present to its users? Are there legal limits to corporate-driven free speech?


Now this would be a Smart City: As hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers struggle to obtain or keep food stamp benefits, baffled by complex filing requirements, City Councilman Ben Kallos (and PDM friend) has introduced legislation that would require city agencies to send people pre-filled applications for the benefits that they are entitled to, Winnie Hu reports for the New York Times. He is also pressing for changes that would eventually allow city residents to receive food stamps automatically based on tax filings.


Avaaz, the international e-organizing behemoth, is facing a technology crisis. According to an email sent by its director, Ricken Patel, its tech backbone is buckling under the strain of communicating with 42 million members, leading to 5 site-wide outages in 4 months. And so they are raising money to hire a new tech team to rebuild its systems from scratch.

Coincidentally, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) yesterday introduced the Spy Car Act, calling on the FTC and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to take steps to protect driver privacy and security against outside hacks.


The war of words between Uber and New York Mayor Bill De Blasio continued to escalate, Matt Flegenheimer of the New York Times reports, with the mayor and his political allies now comparing Uber to corporate behemoths like Wal-Mart.


Interviewed in Rome where he is attending a Vatican conference on climate change, De Blasio told The Guardian, I think its clear that as a corporation, as a multibillion dollar corporation, Uber thinks it can dictate to government. I remind them that the government represents the people and the peoples larger interest, and that is more important than any one companys needs. He also mentioned that he had commiserated with the mayor of Paris, whose own taxi drivers are also at war over the Uber issue.


Ben Popper of The Verge takes a close look at Ubers claim that the citys proposed one-year slowdown on the growth of ride-hailing services would kill its business and concludes, The claim that 10,000 new jobs would disappear if Uber cant license an unlimited supply of new cars is pretty hard to swallow.


In case you think Uber is just like any other tech company trying to get local governments to welcome its business, its worth reading Bloomberg News Karen Weises story from a month ago on how Uber conquered its critics in Portland, Oregon.


The White House has created a Twitter account for @TheIranDeal. The account mainly follows media figures, which makes sense because its part of the Obama administrations sales push for the agreement.

During a Facebook Q&A yesterday, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took a question from the Huffington Posts Alex Howard about what policies she might support to help workers displaced by automation or fending with the uncertainties of the gig economy. Her answer, he notes, was pretty noncommittal, beyond saying that we have to resolve these questions while embracing the promise and potential of these new technologies and without stifling innovation or limiting the ability of working moms and veterans and young people to get ahead.


Ubers NYC general counsel Josh Mohrer wants a face-to-face live-streamed conversation with Mayor Bill de Blasio (so all New Yorkers can watch), but the mayor says I dont debate with private corporations, Gloria Pazmino reports for Capital NY.


Capital NYs Dana Rubinstein recaps the last few weeks of back-and-forth between Uber representatives and City Hall, uncovering enough miscommunication, fits of pique and contradictions to make clear that the current confrontation probably isnt what anyone actually wants, but laying a lot of blame at the Mayors feet. Two paradoxes that jump out of her story: Taxi Workers Alliance founder Bhairavi Desai, who is often at war with the traditional taxi industry over its exploitation of workers, backs the proposed cap on Ubers growth, but does so because what she fears most is how the job of taxi driver itself is becoming unsustainable. And, Rubinstein notes, while De Blasio is saying he wants to protect workers, one of his big tax donors, Evgeny Friedman, has been sued by the attorney general for mistreating his.


Nilay Patel of The Verge explains why we should rue the rush by Apple and Facebook to lure publishers into their mobile web: The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging, massively disruptive success for decades now.

The study builds on earlier work by Laura Kurgan of Columbia University that found a similar pattern in New York City.


Civic Eagle is an early stage mobile app that is hoping to engage ordinary Americans in the public conversation by using short video debates.

Over the weekend at Netroots Nation, activists with #BlackLivesMatter, the Dream Defenders, and the Black Alliance for Just Immigration interrupted the conferences presidential town hall session with candidates Martin OMalley and Bernie Sanders. As David Dayen reports for the New Republic, neither candidate rose to the occasion, presumably because they expected a traditional Democratic party event rather than a democratic power protest.


Netroots Nation, which was originally the Yearly Kos conference, has its roots in the unruly outsiders who crashed the gates of the Democratic establishment in the mid-2000s, but in recent years it has gotten much more professionalized, like a trade show for the liberal-left. This weekends events mark a shift back toward movement politics. And as Chris Savage of Michigans Electablog recounts, the confrontation during the town hall session was a teachable moment for white progressives.


BuzzFeeds editor in chief Ben Smith looks under the hood of the escalating conflict between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Uber and sees a high-stakes confrontation that will absorb his mayoralty and define the politics of Uber and its lesser-known siblings in the flexible, insecure new economy. He reports that City Hall thinks the cap on Ubers expansion in NYC, likely to be voted into law tomorrow, is a boutique side issue that only a small set of excited tech people who are reading Mashable care about, but warns that Uber has unlimited cash and will spend it to chip away at his popularity.


Heres De Blasio in Saturdays Daily News explaining how he sees the stakes in the Uber fight. He writes: When you consider whats at stakefrom ensuring workers can make a decent living, to managing the surge of more than 2,000 new cars on our streets every month, to protecting consumers from overcharges, to making sure we have more accessible vehicles for New Yorkers with disabilitiesits our responsibility to act.


One sign that the fight is escalating: Ubers chief strategist David Plouffe tweets last night: Things are not on the level at NYCs City Hall. Wasnt the City Council told this was all about congestion? Not anymore.

Quartzs Adam Epstein reports on how NASA learned to get good at social media. Its a lovely case study, but it reads as if NASA didnt do anything social or participatory until Twitter came along and a communications staffer, Veronica McGregor, made the spur of the moment decision to start an account for the Mars lander. In fact, as Jeanne Holm, who was then the agencys chief knowledge architect, once told me, it was the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster that showed NASA that it had a distributed network of volunteers (thousands helped collect and map the debris that landed across several states) and fans (the agency had just launched a new website and many people left heartfelt sympathy messages). Those realizations led to a wholesale shift in how NASA engages the public, the fruits of which we now see.

Many tech companies are reluctant to use their platforms directly for political purposes. Think of what it took for Google to decide to make its homepage go dark to protest SOPA/PIPA. Not so Uber, which has just added a DE BLASIO button for its app users in New York City that takes them to a page promising long delays on their service if New Yorks mayor and city council isnt stopped from putting a temporary cap on the number of new cars Uber can add to its base. As Bloomberg News notes, this isnt the first time the company has made such a move.


Heres the petition site that Uber is driving users to. The city council is expected to vote next week on the bill. According to the New York Times, Uber execs met with the mayor and other top officials this week and made clear that they wouldnt accept a higher cap, leading first deputy mayor Anthony Shorris to say that the companys opposition to regulation seemed like some kind of religious issue.


In the New York Times, Michael Barbaro and Ashley Parker trace how many of the presidential candidates, from Jeb Bush to Rand Paul to Hillary Clinton, are navigating the debate over Uber, and by extension, the changing nature of work today. The comments on Bushs post on LinkedIn yesterday attempting to position himself as a disruptive innovator suggest that he isnt in the best position, historically, to claim such a role for himself.


So far, claims by the leading presidential candidates that they are garnering huge grassroots support are not borne out by their actual small-donor fundraising, Kenneth Vogel and Tarini Parti report for Politico.


Less than 1/5 of Hillary Clintons campaign funds have come in amounts of $200 or less, the proverbial small-donor threshold, and the reason may well be this: fewer than 100,000 of the 2.5 million email addresses garnered by her 2008 campaign were still active, as Nicholas Confessore and Maggie Haberman report for the New York Times.


The countries of Georgia, Argentina, Costa Rica, and Mexico all score higher than the United States in terms of how stringently they regulate campaign finance, according to this new global analysis of 54 countries conducted by Global Integrity, the Sunlight Foundation and the Electoral Integrity Project. In terms of actual, practical enforcement of their laws, the United Kingdom comes out way ahead of everyone else.


Read former Reddit CEO Ellen Paos powerful commentary on the challenges of online free speech, and then ponder the choice of her Washington Post editors to title it The trolls are winning the battle for the internet. As I read Pao, thats exactly the opposite of what she believes.


Alex Howard reports on the fun argument that broke out between Clay Johnson and Eric Mill (former colleagues at the Sunlight Foundations Labs) over whether the launch of Democracy.io (noted here yesterday) is a good thing. Johnson thinks really solving the problem of email and Congress requires making software that helps Members of Congress receive and sort through their messages. Mill says that that burden is on Congress, and enabling more people to participate in communicating with their representatives is a good thing. Otherwise, one just ensures that Congress is never made uncomfortable. As Howard says, both men have a point.

The White House is making a push on the digital divide, launching a new pilot program called ConnectHome that will bring free or cheap internet service from a range of participating companies to 275,000 homes in 27 cities, Issie Lapowsky reports for Wired. About half of low-income kids in the U.S. have no web access at home, she notes.

This is civic tech: The Electronic Frontier Foundation has released Democracy.io, a new tool that makes emailing congressional lawmakers as simple as a one-click process that was inspired by the Participatory Politics Foundation and assisted with open-source Congressional contact data from the Sunlight Foundation. Said EFF Tech Fellow Sina Khanifar, who helped develop the tool, Advocacy organizations that can afford it have long had access to tools for delivering bulk constituent messages, but those solutions are expensive for regular citizens. Democracy.io helps to fill in that gap by giving people an easy way to have their voices are heard in Washington.


New York City is rolling out its update to the citys open data law with a primary goal of making it easier for regular people to access information, Capital NYs Miranda Neubauer reports. She notes, As part of the roll-out, the city will be highlighting how to easily visualize data sets from the open data portal using a tool called Data Lens, initially for selected data on universal pre-K locations, restaurant locations, 311 service requests, NYPD motor vehicle collisions, and wi-fi hotspot locations.

Speaking of the rise of social media: 63 percent of Twitter and Facebook users say that each platform serves as a source of news, a new Pew Research Center/Knight Foundation report finds.

Top Hillary Clinton digital advisor Teddy Goff took severe umbrage at yesterdays suggestion by TechCrunch that she was attacking Uber, as this tweet from him shows. Plus he made sure to retweet Silicon Valley investor and Clinton backer Shervin Pishevar, who did his own pushback late yesterday.


By the way, all Clinton actually said in her economic speech, with reference to the sharing economy, was, as Josh Constine of Techcrunch notes, Meanwhile, many Americans are making extra money renting out a spare room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. This on demand or so-called gig economy is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation but its also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future.


Kevin Roose of Fusion says, Welcome to the Uber election, now that the candidates positions on that seminal company and the larger sharing economy appear to be surfacing as a possible issue in the race. Apparently Jeb Bush hailed an Uber yesterday in San Francisco.

This act of favoritism is a first for NASA, which has traditionally just made all of its content freely available via its public website, Alba notes, asking: Is it problematic that a public agency is giving preference to a specific private media outlet?

Hillary Clinton is going to criticize gig economy companies like Uber in a speech today outlining her economic policies, though precisely how tough she will be remains to be seen. An early report by Politicos Michael Grunwald led Techcrunch to headline its story Hillary Clinton Plans To Campaign Against Ubers Contractor Economy but after a clarification from the Clinton campaign to Politico, John Constine retitled his story Hillary Clinton Plans To Cite Ubers Contractor Economy For Dampening Wages.


However its headlined, Clintons stance on companies like Uber may become a hot potato. As Republican digital strategist and RNC senior advisor Mindy Finn tweeted this morning, Nothing says stuck in the past, economically speaking, like a rebuff of the sharing economy...This isnt 2008 anymore.


Sarah Kaplan reports for the Washington Post that Ellen Paos downfall as CEO of Reddit was intimately connected to her efforts to shut down five hate-filled subreddits and that the successful Change.org petition calling for her resignation was started over that issue, not her inelegant firing last week of Victoria Taylor, the moderator of the popular IamA section. She writes of Pao: To her admirers, she was an advocate for inclusion and a pioneering woman in a male-dominated field (only 11 percent of Silicon Valley executives are female and men are twice as likely to be Reddit users than women). To her detractors, she was shill for the social justice warriors who wanted to censor the site and a corporate outsider who was changing their community without bothering to understand it.


Talk about burying the lede! Deep inside this long story in The Atlantic about the Marketplace Lite team of designers and developers that finished the hard work of rebuilding Healthcare.gov after the most critical work of fixing the site was finished, Robinson Meyer notes that one of its successes just came this February, when it launched a new login system for the site. He writes, It is faster and it is cheaper than the old one: The old system responded to requests somewhere between two and 10 long seconds; the new one takes 30 milliseconds, on average. Then he laconically adds: The old login system cost $250 million to build and would have required another $70 million annually to stay online. The new system cost about $4 million to build, and its annual maintenance cost is a little less than $1 million. (Emphasis added. Ive actually heard that it cost less than $4 million but government bean-counters cant technically account for a smaller amount).

Do not miss Alvaro Bedoyas article in Slate warning how tech industry opposition to new privacy measures is leading to the creation of the Loophole of Things. In it, Bedoya, who is the founding executive director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law, explains why he was one of several consumer privacy advocates who two weeks ago walked out of Commerce Department-sponsored talks with industry groups that were trying to set up voluntary rules for companies using facial recognition technology. He warns:
As checks strengthen on government surveillance, tech companies are evading even basic limits on their ability to collect, share, and monetize your data. At the heart of this divide is an increasingly formidable force: industry lobbying. Facial recognition lets companies identify you by name, from far away, and in secret. Theres little you can do to stop it.


Bedoya says that consumer privacy advocates are seeking a basic opt-in rule for the use of facial recognition, but industry lobbyists wont touch it. Worse, this is part of a broader pattern of industry lobbying that is shutting down Washingtons ability to protect consumer privacy.


Newly published documents analyzed by The Intercepts Morgan Marquis-Boire, Glenn Greenwald, and Micah Lee detail how the NSAs XKEYSCORE surveillance program not only include emails, chats and web-browsing traffic, but also pictures, documents, voice calls, webcam photos, web searches, advertising analytics traffic, social media traffic, botnet traffic, logged keystrokes, computer network exploitation (CNE) targeting, intercepted username and password pairs, file uploads to online services, Skype sessions, and more.

Why can only companies with $10 million annual revenue or more present solutions? Will that really help the citizen or exclude too many new ideas? Why are we really certain when we specify a solution that we know it doesnt already exist, or that a better alternative may be out there somewhere? Why do we need to buy a solution?

Two of Ubers top Europe execs, including their France CEO, were taken into custody in Paris yesterday and charged with running illegal taxi operations and concealing documents, TechCrunchs Romain Dillet reports. While the main Uber service is legal in France, its uberPOP service, which enables nonprofessional drivers to offer rides to passengers, is not.


Uber NYC is offering free uberPOOL rides to City Hall today between 10:30am and 2:30pm to steer people to a rally opposing legislation that it says would ban new drivers from joining the company. As Joe Tacopino reports for the New York Post, the City Councils Transportation Committee is considering legislation calling for a study on how ride services are affecting congestion, and it would lead call for a cap on adding new cars while that study is performed.


Reviewing the rise of Uber (and its detractors) in the New Yorker, longtime tech journalist Om Malik makes an important point about what is often called the sharing economy....it often isnt really about sharing. It is an economy driven by our desire for instant gratification. And in an age where we now carry tools for such gratification in our pockets, he suggests that the protests of traditional taxi drivers wont be able to hold back the changed expectations of their customers.


Ubers senior VP of policy and strategy, David Plouffe, tells Caroline Fairchild, the new economy editor of LinkedIn, that every month our driver population becomes more and more part time. I think in the future you might see people driving for Uber just on their commute....Uber and ride-sharing and add to the existing ecosystem. We serve a lot of underserved areas that were sort of transportation deserts. What flows from that is you can help reduce emissions and congestion and you can help get carpooling at scale to work which is something that has eluded the world for decades.


In Bloomberg View, Justin Fox argues that Ubers army of lobbyists are serving the publics interest in having more convenient ways of getting around.


Taking the opposite view, Adam Greenfield argues that Uber represents the rise of a particularly noxious version of smart city ideology that should be resisted.

BoingBoings Cory Doctorow is moving with his family to Los Angeles, in part because the rent is too damn high (in London) and in part because of the shifting political winds. As he writes: The USA is putting curbs on surveillance, expanding its national healthcare, and there are mass parental boycotts of standardised testing in its public schools. The U.K. just elected a Tory majority government thats going to continue to slash and burn the welfare state, attack schools, health, legal aid and teachers, and impose mandatory cryptographic backdoors in the technology we use to talk to each other.


This is civic tech: Patrick Meier reports on one of the most promising humanitarian technology initiatives Ive seen in years, called Peta Jakarta, which is taking real-time crowdsourcing of flooding conditions in that city to a whole new level.


Inside Philanthropys David Callahan says Sean Parkers Wall Street Journal essay on Philanthropy for Hackers deserves close attention for delivering a strong statement for why and how philanthropy should be done better.

Without ever quite calling it Black Twitter, the New York Times Michael Barbaro and Jonathan Martin do a pretty solid job of describing how the online efforts of that influential network have influenced the sudden shift in how South Carolina politicians are approaching the debate over the Confederate flag. On Twitter, they note, the debate was not even close. About 77 percent of those mentioning the issue favored the flags removal, 20 percent expressed neutrality and 3 percent defended its place on the capitol grounds, according to Two.42 solutions, a company that analyzes data and opinion.


Not Black Facebook: New hiring data from Facebook showing essentially no progress in hiring a more diverse group of employees was critiqued by Mike Isaac in the New York Times. He also quote Catherine Bracy of Code for America (and Civic Hall member): If these companies can create self-driving cars and bring internet to the entire world, its not that hard to hire more than one black woman per year. Its not enough to say you care about it.


If you changed your Facebook profile to a rainbow background this weekend, youll want to read this piece by MIT graduate student Nathan Matias who asks in the Atlantic if the companys Celebrate Pride campaign, which encouraged millions of users to color their profile in rainbow shades in honor of Pride and the Supreme Courts marriage equality ruling, wasnt also another internal behavioral experiment. And he cites lots of precedent for why that isnt a far-fetched question.


Speaking of pride, on Twitter, Ethan Roeder, data director for the Obama 08 and 12 campaigns, makes an interesting connection between marriage equality and the current Republican presidential fields tech chops: He asserts: No amount of Koch cash can attract top tech talent when not a single R pres candidate supports gay rights. Sorry fellas. #LoveWins


Speaking of cash: Judging from fresh campaign finance filings by ActBlue, the meta-conduit for many Democratic campaigns, Sen. Bernie Sanders has raised at least $8.3 million online through June 17, Derek Willis reports for the New York Times.


Your crock pot has a lobbyist? Internet of Things companies like FitBit and Belkin, along with bigger tech firms active in the space, are starting to bulk up on Washington lobbyists, reports Tony Romm for Politico. FitBit, for example, has hired Heather Podesta + Partners, while Belkin has hired the Franklin Square Group.


Notably, Congress actual things arent connected to the internet, reports Darren Samuelsohn for Politico. And that air gap is deliberate, keeping the buildings high-tech environmental systems more secure by design.


Insecure by design? Many company privacy policies actually dont protect customer data at all in the event the company gets sold or goes bankrupt, Natasha Singer and Jeremy Merrill report for the New York Times.


Writing in the Wall Street Journal, billionaire Sean Parker, the founder of Napster, argues that todays hacker elite are poised to disrupt the traditional world of philanthropy. Having just set up his own $600 million foundation, he offers some lessons to his peers lest we assimilate into the stodgy institutions of the past and lose our edge. On the one hand, Parker admirably urges hacker philanthropists to avoid creating their own bureaucracies, to make big bets, to be ready to be political, and to try to be humble about the odds of success. On the other hand, he gives us this: Perhaps if [Andrew Carnegie] had lived to see the internet, he would have funded Wikipedia instead. We will never know, but the foundation that bears his name carried on funding libraries even after the internet made them obsolete. Libraries are obsolete? Tell that to the millions of people who go their local library because they cant afford high-speed broadband!


A new research paper by Columbia Universitys Tim Wu, Harvards Michael Luca and the Yelp data team argues that Google has degraded its search results in order to favor its own properties, Larry Dignans reports for ZDNet.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has enhanced its public-facing consumer complaint database, and for the first time is including more than 7,700 actual consumer accounts of problems they are facing. That comes on the heels of a March 2015 decision to allow consumer to opt to make their stories public; since then, the agency says more than half the complaints submitted have chosen that option (scrubbed of personal information). The agency is now seeking public input on how to make this raw complaint data easier for the public to understand and use.


After a year-long push by the OpenGov Foundation, the Sunlight Foundation and the Congressional Data Coalition, Members, committees, and staff of the U.S. House of Representatives are now officially allowed to procure and use open source software tools, the three groups announced yesterday. While this is an important step forward in modernizing the workings of Congress, many other recommendations made by the three groups have yet to be adopted. Those include: the proactive publication of many of Congress working documents, insuring that pending legislation is posting online at least 72 hours before a vote, requiring individual identifiers in lobbyist disclosure reports, allowing more journalists (read bloggers) to be credentialed by Congress press galleries, along with more systemic fixes.

Presidential candidate Jeb Bush takes to Medium to argue that the Obama administration isnt taking cyber-security seriously enough. While recent security breaches like the hack of the Office of Personnel Management show this remains a serious problem, this complaint is a bit rich coming from the former Florida governor, who bragged about releasing a trove of emails from his governorship and then later had to scramble to remove tons of personally identifying information of thousands of ordinary citizens he communicated with.


Ed OKeefe of the Washington Post digs into that email trove and finds that Bush took a fair amount of heat from constituents angry about his decision to take down the states Confederate flags and put them in a history museum.

He adds:
There is a cadre of young folks, native to the Internet, who Get It. They are infused with a spirit of play, they assume collaboration, they like to push against edges, and they are aware of the challenges the openness of the Internet faces. I do not believe this culture is going to vanish. In fact, it is thriving in some of the most important sites on the web. For example, Reddit at its best not only takes advantage of the freedom the Internet gives us, it takes it as a topic. The Internets spirit lives in the hackathons and the engineering culture that has come to dominate the mainstream. It even lives at sites like YouTube where, in a fully corporately-owned space, people make things to delight one another.

On Friday, WikiLeaks began publishing 70,000 documents from a trove of more than half a million cables and other material from inside the Saudi Arabian foreign ministry and other state agencies. The files appear to have been obtained by a group calling itself the Yemeni Cyber Army. Many of the early findings center on how the Saudi government curries favor with media outlets around the world, in part by buying hundreds or thousands of subscriptions in selected publications.


Writing in the Washington Post, Middle East expert Marc Lynch says, it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of these leaks. They are likely to matter more than many of the previous such leaks because of how they resonate with two of the most potent issues in todays Middle East: the regional proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran; and fierce Arab regime efforts to control an inexorably expanding Arab public sphere and erase the gains of the 2010-2011 uprisings.

Noting signs that these attacks may have been done by the same group that targeted Anthem, the health insurer, and United Airlines, he writes, When pulled together into an analytical database, the information could essentially become a LinkedIn for spies, providing a foreign intelligence organization with a way to find individuals with the right job titles, the right connections, and traits that might make them more susceptible to recruitment or compromise.

Sean Parkers $9 million civic start-up Brigade is starting to come out of stealth mode, giving select users early access to its mobile app, reports Greg Ferenstein for The Guardian. If you happened to be a user of the Accord app over the last few months, you were actually playing with the stealth version of this first version of Brigade.


Politicos Nancy Scola, the Washington Posts Ana Swanson, and Mashables JP Mangalindan also report on Brigades launch.


All three stories describe how the Brigade app works to get users to share lots of granular information about their political views, inviting them to collect supporters for their views, and nudging them to debate micro-issues. They also note how the app builds on top of existing social graph data that Brigade has from its acquisition of Facebook Causes and Votizenwhich apparently enables it to infer political associations between users even before they share their opinions on issues (one friend of mine got my message asking them to be a supporter that noted we have similar views on climate change, elections and government, even before he had shared a single view of his own on the app).

A bipartisan working group led by heavy-hitters from recent Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns, chaired by the Annenberg Public Policy Centers Kathleen Hall Jamieson, has issued a major 47-page report chock-a-block with recommendations for increasing the value and viewership of presidential general election debates, arguing they need to be updated to take into account the rise of early voting, the ubiquity of social media, the spread of alternative media networks, changes in campaign financing, and the increase in independent voters. Heres my quick take.


In other news, National Journals Shane Goldmacher offers an excellent soup-to-nuts catalog of the many ways presidential campaigns are trying to take advantage of Facebooks unrivaled advertising and targeting opportunities. He writes: 
Thanks to powerful new features unveiled since the 2012 campaign, Facebook now offers a far more customized and sophisticated splicing of the American electorate. And, for the first time in presidential politics, it can serve up video to those thinly targeted sets of people. That unprecedented combination is inching campaigns closer to the Holy Grail of political advertising: the emotional impact of television delivered at an almost atomized, individual level. It makes the old talk of micro-targeting soccer moms and NASCAR dads sound quaint.


Derek Willis of the New York Times Upshot section notes that Jeb Bush, who just formally announced his candidacy, has being doing little to build a robust online presence.


Digital strategist Mike Connery took a close look at the websites of 25 top think tanks, and what he found probably wont surprise you: The vast majority arent making full use of social media sharing or embedding of their data. And yes, think tanks still love to post their content in .pdf files. We have yet to see the emergence of a true, digitally native think tank, he writes, offering a range of innovative ideas worth studying. He also shares this tidbit from the World Bank:

In an analysis of their own PDF reports conducted last year, the World Bank found that 1/3 of all reports published in PDF format by the bank had never been downloaded. Fewer than 13 percent had been downloaded more than 250 times, making PDF filesthe dominant format think tanks use to present informationalmost wholly ineffective in helping think tanks achieve their goals.


Sam Gustin of Vices Motherboard takes a close look at the potential rise of the internet voter, building on conversations he tracked while attending Personal Democracy Forum earlier this month.


Michael Cornfield of George Washington University took seven of his grad students to PDF, and in this post he explains why belonging to the civic community is essential to innovating successfully.


Saving face? Nine major civil liberties and consumer advocate groups have withdrawn from ongoing talks with trade associations over facial recognition technology regulations because they couldnt achieve a minimum goal of insuring that companies would first seek and obtain permission from people before employing such techniques to identify them in public, Natasha Singer reports for the New York Times.


Meanwhile, as privacy scholar Kate Crawford helpfully points out on Twitter, companies sell facial recognition software for churches to track people attending services.


Thirteen years after legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security included a provision creating the National Emergency Technology Guard, FEMA is finally signing agreements with major tech companies setting up the service, Jeff Mapes reports for The Oregonian.

Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, whose outsider presidential campaign is polling at 32 percent in New Hampshire (compared to 44 percent for Hillary Clinton), tells the Daily Beasts Eleanor Clift, I have a lot of respect and admiration for Barack Obama, but the biggest mistake he made after running one of the great campaigns in American history was saying to the legions of people who supported him, Thank you very much for electing me, Ill take it from here. Sanders added, I will not make that mistake.


In The Intercept, Jon Schwartz reminds readers how Marshall Ganz, one of the key architects of Obamas grassroots organizing strategy in 2008, came to criticize Obama for demobilizing the army that elected him.

Writing in the New York Observer, former Democratic congressional aide and Hill columnist Brent Budowsky puts the odds of Sanders upsetting Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucus at nearly 40 percent.


According to Google Trends, interest in United States in the search term Bernie Sanders has just surpassed interest in the term Hillary Clinton. (Interest in both is substantially higher than Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz.)


Speaking of Obama mistakes, Alex Howard takes a closer look in the Huffington Post at how President Obama came to personally invest in recruiting technology talent for his administration, building on yesterdays story by Jon Gertner for Fast Company.


Shazna Nessa and Jennifer Preston of the Knight Foundation take to the foundations blog to explain why it is investing $2.6 million to create a mobile lab inside Guardian U.S. to experiment with new and engaging ways for people to consumer news on smaller screens.

Kelly McBride, the vice president at the Poynter Institute, meditates in a New York Times op-ed on when it is OK to pay for a story, focusing in particular on the bounty WikiLeaks is raising to entice someone to leak the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. The job of journalism in a democracy is to exercise scrutiny to hold power accountable, McBride writes. Given the TPPs secrecy, WikiLeaks crowd-sourced leak-funding campaign, which has raised about $56,000 to date, can be seen as a logical response to a process designed to thwart public debate, an investment in democracy even.


Yesterday, Matter announced investments in three new media companies: This, a social platform for sharing better media (the This team are also members of Civic Hall); Parlio, a platform for conversation about world issues co-founded by one of the activists who helped launch the 2011 Egyptian Revolution; and NewsWhip, a company that wants to parse conversations online to find the most interesting stories out there and share that insight with media companies.

Marc Caputo and Alex Isenstadt report for Politico on the shake-up inside Jeb Bushs soon-to-be-announced presidential campaign team, noting the departure of Matt Lira, a top GOP digital strategist, who one source said left because the campaign was too focused on TV advertising and not enough on building a digital presence.


Rival Vincent Harris, who is running digital for Rand Pauls president campaign, tweets With no digital head, how behind is team Bush at building digital/data infrastructure? Whos even left to hire?


Notably, it was just two weeks ago that the Bush non-campaign was touting the face that Lira had been hired to advise its leadership PAC, as Jon Ward reported then for Yahoo Politics.


Many Democratic digerati are treading carefully as they try not to rein their chances for a future spot on the [Clinton] campaign, Nancy Scola reports for Politico. The one major exception is Revolution Messaging, which has signed on with Sen. Bernie Sanders campaign.


The White Houses chief information officer, Tony Scott, has issued a memorandum requiring that federal websites and web services upgrade to HTTPS by the end of 2016, Alex Howard reports for the Huffington Post. Comments on GitHub appear to have sped up the timeline for adoption, according to 18Fs Eric Mill, who spoke to Howard. HTTPS everywhere makes the whole government stronger, and the whole Web stronger, Mill notes.


Republican data firm Echelon Insights, co-founded by Patrick Ruffini, took a close look at Twitter conversations about politics and discovered, to no ones surprise, that Beltway Twitter (partisan activists and the press corps) is far more obsessed with itself than the rest of the country, Paul Singer reports for USA Today. One interesting finding in the data, which goes back a year: So-called non-political Twitter users were twice as interested in the Freddie Gray killing in Baltimore than Beltway elites.

Speaking at the press conference at the G-7 summit in Germany, President Obama said that cyberattacks on the U.S. government and private sector are not going to go awayits going to accelerate, Cory Bennett reports for The Hill.


Feminist writer and internet troll slayer Lindy West gets lovingly interviewed by Cosmopolitans Jill Filipovic. Best line: People tend to be like, Oh, yeah, the internet, its a cesspool, its just like that. But no, its not just like thatwe make it. We are currently in the process of building it. Its still a baby, and we have the opportunity to build it better. That refrain of thats just how the internet is needs to die.


Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced yesterday that the department would forgive the loans of many students who attended the now-bankrupt for-profit Corinthian Colleges, a seeming victory for the Debt Collective, which organized hundreds of students to go on a debt strike seeking relief. (Co-organizer Astra Taylor described this campaign in her keynote at PDF 2015 on Friday.)


In response to Duncan, the Debt Collective issued a statement criticizing the department for forcing students into a complicated process for discharging their debts instead of immediately and automatically ending them. Students are entitled to receive full relief under law, the statement said. The legal and most painless possible process for students is no processthey deserve an automatic discharge of their debts. More than 1,200 students have now joined in pledging to strike their own loans unless the department issues a class-wide cancellation of the Corinthian debts.


Three new research papers funded by the World Bank were released by Tiago Peixoto. One shows that online voting increases total turnout in participatory budgeting in Rio Grande do Sol; the second shows that a successful first experience using FixMyStreet.com to report a service request makes that person 54 percent more likely to submit a second request (i.e. government responsiveness has positive civic effects); and the third examines the effectiveness of mobile phone-based surveys in poor countries.

All the main hall talks from Personal Democracy Forum 2015 can now be watched, speaker by speaker.


More gleanings from conference attendees:


Writing for CivSource, Bailey McCann observed that the two-day conference showed a new version of civic tech that has come down to earth and is willing to focus more of its attention on the challenges of governing, as it is on the next new and shiny app.


Knight Foundation VP of communications, Andrew Sherry, a regular at PDF, shares some highlights, writing that PDF15 was about the intersection of technology, human behavior, and society.


Keynote speaker Deanna Zandt, whose talk was called Imagine All the Feelz, reflects on wrestling with personal demons that made her question whether her talk about emotional intimacy in the internet age was too squishy. (It wasnt!)


PDF attendee Yangbo Du Storified his conference highlights.


Mozilla PDF Fellow Jerry Hall blogs about his experience, writing that one of the most important panels held was the #BlackTwitter and #BlackLivesMatter: Turning Pain Into Political Power [panel] moderated by Kimberly Ellis. He writes: What I learned from the amazing women on the #BlackLivesMatter panel is how the black community uses Twitter as a tool to communicate, to build and share their common identity, to help each other through instances of obvious racism or interactions with the ignorant, and to be their own un-white-filtered news channel. What I heard loud and clear was a direct ask for help, for all of us white and black, to plant seeds, start and nurture engaging each other. I didnt hear this as a desperate peoples ask but, that from strong, powerful and engaged fellow-Americans.

The U.S. government is saying that Chinese hackers are responsible for breaking into the computer systems of the Office of Personnel Management and stealing security clearance information on up to 4 million current and former federal employees, going back to 1985, Andrea Shalal and Matt Spetalnick report for Reuters.  


According to an internal audit released last year, the OPM didnt even know where all of its servers were, Andrea Peterson reports for the Washington Post.


Note: The same U.S. government that now stands exposed to severe security breaches as a result of this hack is still arguing that it should have backdoor access to the communications of the rest of us, and that it can be trusted to protect those keys.

A single social media post led the Air Force to bomb an ISIS building, Mike Hoffman reports for Defense Tech. It was a post on social media to bombs on target in less than 24 hours, Air Force General Hawk Carlisle said. Incredible work when you think about. Yes, his first name is Hawk.


Writing in the New York Review of Books, veteran media analyst Michael Massing surveys the current state of digital journalism, smartly parsing the value of Buzzfeed, Vox, FiveThirtyEight, and The Intercept. Looking beyond these efforts, he also notes on virtually any subject these days, you can find opinionated, informative, provocative sites and blogs. Though he praises the rise of growth of this digital ecosystem, Massing worries that its fragmentation has also made it harder to reach a broader audience, enter the political discourse and make a difference.


The once golden power couple of Chris Hughes (Facebook co-founder, Obama online organizer, New Republic owner) and Sean Eldridge (gay rights organizer, failed Congressional candidate) gets the Vanity Fair treatment from Sarah Ellison.


The internet of things came home to PR strategist (and PDM friend) Peter Himler: The home he bought in the Hamptons came with an expensive Crestron app-based heating and cooling system, which at first seemed nifty until the local Crestron dealer used it to rip him off.


From conservative blogger Michelle Malkin to liberal media critic Jay Rosen, lots of people are unhappy about Twitters decision to shut down Politwoops, the Sunlight Foundations tool for tracking deleted tweets from politicians, Sunlights Nicko Margolies reports.

Nancy Lublin, the executive director of both DoSomething and CrisisTextLine, tweets, I got a dozen emails from ppl after my pdf15 remarks about fdtns. All agree but too scared to speak up.

Its the second day of Personal Democracy Forum 2015 and you can still catch the livestream beginning at 9am EST.


Microsofts Bay Area Staff drafted a quick post on how to tell if Personal Democracy Forum is for you, concluding that This years PDF is for everyone.


Miranda Neubauer digs up all the relevant-to-PDF civic tech and govtech happenings in New York City for Capital New York.


For a quick overview of yesterdays main stage talks, Jeff Swift has pulled together a Storify for Part One, Part Two, and Part Three.


For Civicist, Lauren Mobertz, a Mozilla fellow at the conference, shares five takeaways from the breakout session on labs for social and economic empowerment.


Yesterday, during his main stage talk, Jim Gilliam launched a book with the same title as his PDF talk in 2011, The Internet Is My Religion. NationBuilder has the Storify.


Zeynep Tufekci takes to the opinion pages of the New York Times to ask Mark Zuckerberg to make users Facebooks customer. Facebooks chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, seems to have plenty of money, she writes, but Id like to give him some of mine. I want to pay a small fee for the right to keep my information private and to be able to hear from the people I wantnot the sponsored-content makers I want to avoid. I want to be a customer, not a product.


Also in the New York Times Opinion section: Edward Snowden, writing on the two-year anniversary of the publications of stories based on NSA documents he provided.


During Tristan Harriss PDF talk on Time Well Spent, yesterday, he cited a mechanism from Couchsurfing that tracked net good times as a design for time well spent. Nithin Coca respectfully disagreed, and pointed to an article he wrote for The Kernel in May on the improbable rise and fall of Couchsurfing.


For Foreign Policy, Thomas Carothers asks why technology hasnt delivered more democracy, and six experts weigh in: Martin Tisne, of the Omidyar Network; Larry Diamond, of the Hoover Institution and Stanford University; Senem Aydin Duzgit, of Istanbul Bilgi University; Rakesh Rajani, of the Ford Foundation; Diane de Gramont, a student at Yale University; and Golnaz Esfandiari, of Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe.


Thomas Carothers provides a TL;DR: The contributors answers to the puzzle of why the advance of new communication technologies in the past fifteen years has not produced any overall advance of democracy in the world boil down to three different lines: First, its too soon to see the full effects. Second, the positive potential effects are being partially outweighed or limited by other factors, including some larger countervailing trends on the international political stage for democracy, the ability of authoritarian governments to use the same technologies for their own anti-democratic purposes, and the only partial reach of these technologies in many countries. And third, technology does not solve some basic challenges of democracy building, above all, stirring citizens to engage in collective action and the establishment of effective representative institutions. Sounds like theyre on the same page as most PDF15 attendees.


The Gawker Media Staff decided to unionize. The next steps, they write, are determining what we want to bargain for; forming a bargaining committee; and negotiating a contract. You know, the easy stuff!


The President of the Sunlight Foundation, Christopher Gates, has written a eulogy for Politwoops. The key grafs: 
Days after Politwoops launched in 2012, Twitter contacted the Sunlight Foundation and told us, Your service violates our API Terms of Service on a fundamental level. We explained the goals of the project and agreed to create a human curation workflow to ensure that the site screened out corrected low-value tweets like typos, links and Twitter handles. We implemented this layer of journalistic judgment with blessings from Twitter and the site continued.
We are truly mystified as to what prompted the change of heart, and its deeply disappointing to see Twitter kill a project they had supported since 2012. It is also disturbing to us that our feed was cut almost three weeks ago and our only direct communication came from Twitter last night, when we were told that their decision was not something that we could appeal, and, most surprisingly, they were not interested in reviewing any of the email conversation from 2012.Clearly, something changedand were not likely to ever know what it was.

Personal Democracy Media and Civic Hall are pleased to announce the publication of the book A Lever and a Place to Stand: How Civic Tech Can Move the World, a collection of articles about civic tech and engagement by Rebecca Chao, Denise Cheng, Allison Fine, Alexander B. Howard, Matt Leighninger, Jessica McKenzie, Eilis ONeill, Sam Roudman, and Micah L. Sifry. Copies will be available for purchase at Personal Democracy Forum, or you can order your paperback or ebook online.


Today is the first day of Personal Democracy Forum! Follow along with the main stage talks on our PDF15 livestream and on Twitter with the hashtag #PDF15. If youre attending and still undecided as to which breakout sessions youll attend, check out this handy guide.


Christina Hawatmeh, the founder of Protestify, has created a visualization for the hashtag #PDF15. Keep an eye on it over the next two days! (ICYMI: I wrote about Protestify earlier this year.)


The Knight Foundation has released a report that seeks to explain why young voters (meaning millennials) might participate in national elections but not local elections. A lack of information and news coverage of local politics and candidates was found to be the biggest obstacle for participation. The report outlines a few things that could be done to increase voter turnout, including offering welcome packets to new city residents and engaging millennials more on digital platforms. One interesting tidbit from the report: millennials are especially tired of hearing that the system is broken.' Jon Sotsky, the Knight Foundation director for strategy and assessment, will be speaking on a PDF panel this afternoon at2pm on Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Participation.


This morning Rick Perry announced that he is running for president in 2016, Manny Fernandez reports for the New York Times.


Myfanwy Nixon writes for MySociety that the data from YourNextMP (whichWendy M. Grossman covered for techPresident earlier this year) was used in more than 20 projects, including ones by Google and the Guardian. In the weeks leading up to the election, Nixon reports the site had an average of 20,000 visitors a day, and on May 6, the day before the election, that shot up to 160,000 visitors.


The U.S. army is trying out bug drones, reports AJ Dellinger for the Daily Dot.


Out in San Francisco, Andy Greenberg made an untraceable semiautomatic rifle in his office, and he writes in Wired that it was easy: All I needed for my entirely legal DIY gunsmithing project was about six hours, a 12-year-olds understanding of computer software, an $80 chunk of aluminum, and a nearly featureless black 1-cubic-foot desktop milling machine called the Ghost Gunner.


Kevin Roose writes in Fusion that the sun might be about to set on all of the Uber for X companies that proliferated in 2014. His speculation inspiration: Carolyn Saids report in the San Francisco Chronicle last week that Homejoy, an Uber for house-cleaning, is struggling and might be for sale. Bonus: Do you remember which company in the late 1990s/early-aughts lost $1.50 to every dollar taken in?


Socratas Kevin Merritt has written an interesting thinkpiece in Quartz on govtech and the new(ish) revolving door from Silicon Valley to Washington, D.C. As we look towards the future, he concludes, its becoming increasingly clear that were currently witnessing a second American Revolution; but this time the government is being radically re-shaped by data-driven digital innovators who channel the thinking of Steve Jobs rather than patriotically-driven lawyers who accessed the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Hmm.


RIP, Politwoops: Twitter has revoked the Sunlight Foundations API access for their Politwoops site, reports J.K. Trotter for Gawker. A Twitter representative told Gawker that preserving deleted Tweets violates our developer agreement.


The New Media Ventures Innovation Fund is now accepting applications. Julie Menter, a manager at New Media Ventures, writes in an email to Civicist: Today, were excited to announce our next Open Call. We are seeking to make investments and grants in scalable media startups. Note that we define media broadly to include content creation, distribution, and promotion. Our Innovation Fund finances early-stage, for-profit and nonprofit startups with $50K, participation in NMVs startup support program and access to NMVs network of angel investors. Deadline is June 28, 2015.


This is civic tech: CivilHub, a platform for community organization, from the bottom-up. We havent had a chance to play around on it yet, but we sure are looking forward to it!


New hire: The former director of Open NY, Andrew Nicklin, has been hired by Johns Hopkins University to lead the open data team at the new (launched in April) Center for Government Excellence. Congrats!

The Electronic Frontier Foundations Cindy Cohn and Mark Jaycox explain why they are celebrating the Senates passage of the USA Freedom Act, even though EFF wanted it to go much further in strengthening privacy protections. They write, Passing a bill is far more difficult than simply killing a bad bill, and takes more sustained pressure from the public, a massive publicity campaign around a central issue, deep connections to lawmakers, and the coordination of diverse groups from across the political spectrum.The USA Freedom Act shows that the digital rights community has leveled up. Weve gone from just killing bad bills to passing bills that protect peoples rights.


Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, is passionate about privacy, as TechCrunchs Matthew Panzarino reports. Honored by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Cook said, Im speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information. Theyre gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think thats wrong. And its not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.


WikiLeaks is seeking to raise $100,000 as a bounty for the leaking of chapters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Amy Goodman of Democracy Now reports in an interview with Julian Assange.


Last we heard about Russias army of paid internet trolls, they were mainly focused on building support for Vladimir Putin and his intervention in Ukraine. Now, as Adrian Chen describes in a long feature in the Sunday New York Times Magazine, theres evidence that this force, centered on the so-called Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, may also be involved in various public safety hoaxes that have floated across American news pages in the last year.


Chen also notes that the pro-Kremlin troll army has contributed to a dawning sense, among the Russian journalists and activists I spoke with, that the internet is no longer a natural medium for political opposition....The internet still remains the one medium where the opposition can reliably get its message out. But their message is now surrounded by so much garbage from trolls that readers can become resistant before the message even gets to them.


Hillary Clintons digital director Katie Dowd gets profiled by Nina Easton in Fortune Magazine, covering Dowds past work in the State Department on TechCamp, which trained civil society groups around the country in how to use social media and web tools for activism. (See also Eastons profile of Clinton campaign CTO Stephanie Hannon, which ran last week.)


Next week, MoveOn and Democracy for America will suspend their Run Warren Run effort to draft Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to run for president, Ilya Sheyman and Charles Chamberlain, the groups heads, write in Politico. But they argue that they succeeded in embedding Warrens populist economic themes in the presidential contest and sent a message to other progressive Democrats, showing that grassroots progressives are ready to lift up candidates who refuse to kiss the rings of those corrupting our political system and rigging our economy.


A new New York Times/CBS poll shows deep support among Republicans and Democrats alike for new measures to restrict the influence of wealthy givers, including limiting the amount of money that can be spent by super PACs and forcing more public disclosure on organizations now permitted to intervene in elections without disclosing the names of their donors, report Nicholas Confessore and Megan Thee-Brenan. 39 percent of Americans say they want fundamental changes in the ways campaigns are funded, while 46 percent say they want the system completely rebuilt. A majority also say they dont consider money given to candidates to be a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment.

Bad news about the news business? Online millennials (born 1981-1996) and online baby boomers (born 1946-1964) are almost mirror opposites in terms of where they get their political news, the Pew Research Centers Amy Mitchell, Jeffrey Gottfried and Katerina Eva Matsa report. Of the former, 61 percent say Facebook is their main source of weekly political news, while 60 percent of the latter say local TV is.


As Facebook itself has released research showing that its News Feed algorithm contributes to political cloistering, this heavy reliance by millennials on Facebook for political news could be concerning, though Pews researchers are quick to point out their finding that it is the Facebook users in the oldest of the three generations studied here who are most likely to see political content on the site that supports their own views: 31% of Baby Boomers on Facebook who pay attention to political posts say the posts they see are mostly or always in line with their own views, higher than both Generation Xers (21%) and Millennials (18%).


Some fun facts buried deep in Pews report:


Among online news sources, the Huffington Post is both better known and more trusted by Millennials than Politico. 62 percent have heard of it and 20 percent trust it; just 20 percent have heard of Politico and only 7 percent trust it.


BuzzFeed is down in the trashbin side of the media ecosystem, more distrusted than trusted, along with the Sean Hannity Show, Breitbart, the Glenn Beck Program, and the Rush Limbaugh Show. (Its worth noting, re: the latter four, that Pew didnt survey the silent generation of pre-baby boomers for this report, since relatively few are online.)


Millennials trust the Daily Show for news a lot more than gen Xers or baby boomers.




Good news about the news business? It could be that Dutch people are crazy. Or, it could be that the innovative journalism aggregator Blendle has figured out how to make micropayments work. In this post on Medium, co-founder Alexander Klopping reports on the startups first year, growing to more than 250,000 users mostly under the age of 35, many of whom, he says, are paying for great journalism.


Among his findings: depending on online advertising is a losers game; metered payrolls that force readers to pay for bundled content from legacy sites might work for a huge newspaper (like the [New York] Times) in a huge market, but it wont for smaller papers in smaller markets; and in Blendles model, news doesnt sell, but background pieces, great analyses, opinion pieces and long interviews do.


My favorite part of Blendles model: users punish clickbait by refunding. That is, people only pay for the articles they read, but they can ask for their money back if they dont like the story. And something like 50 percent do so for gossip articles, while only around 5 percent do so overall on the site. (h/t Clay Shirky)

The Senates failure to act yesterday means that some post-9/11 surveillance powers used, and some argue abused, by the U.S. government under the Patriot Act have at least temporarily expired, a victory for the strange bedfellow coalition of libertarian conservatives and liberals inspired by Edward Snowdens revelations two years ago. The Senate is now poised to pass the USA Freedom Act, which has already passed the House, refusing to simply renew the Patriot Acts mass surveillance provisions as had been desired by surveillance hawks like Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Commenting on Snowdens impact, Sen.

New research from political scientists Jennifer Lawless and Richard Fox finds that American millennials overwhelmingly say they are uninterested in running for office, which is a long-term problem when you consider that there are more than 500,000 elected offices in America. Interviewed by Voxs Ezra Klein, Lawless argues that todays media system is intensifying this feeling of alienation:

Its about heightened exposure to the most egregious examples of political malpractice. Weve gotten to a point where it takes about five seconds before somebody who wants to find out something about the political system happens across bad news. If youre a casual consumer of news and youre just looking at your Facebook feed, chances are youre not reading a headline about the successes of Obamacare. And if youre a political junkie and youre choosing what you want to see, you might see successes from your side, but you also see a lot of outrage from other people. Its all just disagreement. When we asked kids in these interviews whether they talked politics with their friends, they said, basically, Why would we want to do that?

#PDF15 is one week away! Weve posted the Personal Democracy Forum 2015 guide to the 27 breakout sessions taking place during next weeks conference. And Im happy to report that the overall gender breakdown of our 131 confirmed speakers is 66 men, 64 women and one transgender person. (Who says you cant #changetheratio? This is our fourth year in a row with gender parity among speakers.)


Food for thought (1): Innovation That Matters, a new 154-page report on civic innovation focused on eight major U.S. cities finds that cities with the most developed civic tech ecosystems are cities where civic entrepreneurs feel confident in their ability to reach out to mentors, investors, anchor institutions such as universities and larger businesses, and gatekeepers within municipal government and receive some type of response, Andrew Zaleski reports for Next City. Building better integration between the network of actors within a given community is the most important factor in increasing civic entrepreneurship, says the report, which is a joint venture of the 1776 incubator in Washington D.C. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.


San Francisco, which the reports authors note obviously has a very strong tech community, is still working to bridge the gap between tech and civic institutions. [T]he traditional tech entrepreneurship model pioneered in Silicon Valley has not yet discovered a method to fully collaborate with existing institutional resources, Zaleski notes, citing the reports authors. New York, he says, an established civic tech ecosystem, proves to be the model on this front.


Food for thought (2): Here are a few highlights from Mary Meekers annual Internet Trends report, released yesterday:


While the consumer sector of the U.S. economy has been totally impacted by the internet, Meeker says the three least-impacted sectors, by comparison, are education, healthcare and government/regulation/policy thinking.


87 percent of American millennials say my smartphone never leaves my side, night or day and 60 percent believe in the next five years, I believe everything will be done on mobile devices.


34 percent of millennials prefer to collaborate online at work as opposed to in-person or by phone, nearly double the level for older generations.


In Shanghai, Tencent WeChat users can get the following government services through their mobile app: hospital appointments, payments for electricity/water/gas bills, obtain travel documents, smog test appointments, property tax lookups, driving violation lookups, and weather/library search.




Food for thought (3): With Voxs purchase of Re/Code as the latest piece of unspoken context, John Herrman of The Awl takes a hard look at the state of online media and the race for traffic, and comes to two critical conclusions you may want to ponder long and hard: First, In most cases...a publisher reliant on platformsreluctantly or enthusiasticallyis required to give up a substantial part of its identity. It borrows its audience. It takes editorial cues from the company from which the audience is borrowed. It rents space not just with promises of unusually high-quality content, but, in some cases, with the splitting of revenue. This is a situation in which success is aligned with sublimation.


And second, the next year is going see a fairly large shaking-out: an elimination of redundancy by platforms that incidentally encouraged it; a choosing of partners and therefore winners and losers; a fundamental change in the terms that publishers thought they had with the platforms theyve come to depend on, even though the platforms never actually promised anything. Some of the most successful websites may prove to be the most vulnerable. The speed and nimbleness with which they were able to appear, grow, and surpass their print-centric predecessors publishing businesses on the internet was dazzling; so too will be the speed with which they can disappear.

In the interest of greater transparency, the Clinton Foundation has posted a list of paid speeches its principals (Hillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton) have made that have helped support its work. The details are tantalizingly limited: for example, of three speeches listed by President Clinton that earned between half a million and a million dollars (per speech!), one is attributed to something called Hanwha. (Thats one of South Koreas largest business conglomerates.)


Under Clintons leadership, the State Department approved $165 billion worth of commercial arms sales to 20 nations whose governments have given money to the Clinton Foundation, report David Sirota and Andrew Perez for the International Business Times, analyzing State Department and Clinton Foundation data. They add: In all, governments and corporations involved in the arms deals approved by Clintons State Department have delivered between $54 million and $141 million to the Clinton Foundation as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the Clinton family, according to foundation and State Department records. The Clinton Foundation publishes only a rough range of individual contributors donations, making a more precise accounting impossible.


The State Department is proposing to release batches of Clintons private emails every two months, starting in June, Josh Gerstein reports for Politico.


Remember how the Obama campaign experimented with all kinds of email formats? Hillary Clintons presidential campaign has now launched The Feed (subtitled: Read It, Watch It, Share It) which gets delivered to your inbox like any other campaign email, but looks and feels like a graphically punched-up e-newsletter stocked with the campaigns latest social sharing ploys. You can only get it by joining the campaign.


Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) held a campaign rally in his home city of Burlington, where locals long loyal to his independent and socialist politics mingled with former Occupy Wall Street organizers like Charles Lenchner and Winnie Wong, who are assisting his campaign, reports Jonathan Topaz for Politico.

The Internal Revenue Service admitted yesterday that attackers obtained the tax information of 100,000 filers, using previously stolen information to crack the get transcript feature on the IRS website, Andy Greenberg reports for Wired.


Why did the first FCC chairman under President Obama, Julius Genachowski, waver in his declared support for the open internet despite being a tech entrepreneur with a personal relationship with the president, while the second chairman, Tom Wheeler, a former telco industry lobbyist, delivered as a forceful champion of net neutrality? In Mediums BackChannel, Susan Crawford offers her theory of the case.


Bart Myers, the CEO of Countable, writes a smart op-ed in The Hill about the future of political and civic tech: There will be limited growth for those who believe that techs future in policy and advocacy is just creating mini echo chambers, where people with an issue in common join ranks among themselves for politicians to target them....On the other hand, the political apps and websites that will find success are the ones that will place less emphasis on divisions. They will drive constant reengagement by introducing people to a wider array of issues and causes that audiences might not have been aware of, but care about.

With the Patriot Act reauthorization vote stymied in the Senate, security analyst Bruce Schneier points to critical commentary by the ACLUs chief technologist Chris Soghoian noting that the failure to extend Section 215 of the act will not end other forms of bulk surveillance, including bulk orders to calling card companies, Skype and BOIP companies.


Related: Philip Zimmerman, the inventor of the email encryption system Pretty Good Privacy, explains to Juliette Garside of the Guardian why he has moved his company Silent Circle to Switzerland: Every dystopian society has excessive surveillance, but now we see even western democracies like the U.S. and England moving that way, he warns. We have to roll this back. People who are not suspected of committing crimes should not have information collected and stored in a database. We dont want to become like North Korea. (Must interesting nugget from this story: Among Silent Circles backers is one Ross Perot Jr., son of the 1992 U.S. presidential candidate.)


Bonus quote from Zimmerman: A certain amount of elbow grease has to be expended when the police do their work. If it becomes too frictionless, you can slide more easily into a police state. I think we should restore a little bit of that friction.

Eighty-eight percent of Americans do not want to be watched without their permission, Mary Madden and Lee Rainie report, citing data from two new surveys of public opinion done by the Pew Research Center.

The first GOP presidential debate, which will take place August 6 in Cleveland, will be presented by Fox News in partnership with Facebook, the two companies announced yesterday. According to a joint release, the debate will feature Facebook data illustrating how the issues of the day are resonating with people on todays largest platform for political conversation. FOX News viewers and Facebook users will also be able to share images and video questions via Facebook, some of which will be used to help formulate questions for the candidates and broadcast during the debate. According to Andy Mitchell, Facebooks news and partnerships director, Foxs use of Facebook demonstrates how the platform has become an essential part of the political process.

In the New Republic, Nathan Schneider (Civic Hall member) writes in praise of what he calls the Slow Computing movement, likening his use of free and open software like Ubuntu and Emacs and a locally-based service called ownCloud, to the Slow Food movement. To wit:

There is a habit in tech culture of saying that the latest app is democratizing whatever it happens to do. This is lovely, but best not to confuse it with actual democracy. Democracy is about participation with control, freedom with accountability, privacy with transparency. Tech companies tend to pick and choose from that list rather inventively. Were expected to participate in their networks without having control over how they work. Were transparent about every detail of our lives with them, while theyre private about what they do with it. Free-and-open software, however, operates on a different time-scale. Since nobody owns it, its harder to become fabulously wealthy from it. People make these programs because they need them, not because they think they can manipulate someone to want them. Its slower. Instead of relying on rich kids in a Googleplex somewhere, Slow Computing works best when were employing people nearby...

New Americas Kevin Bankston has organized a letter to President Obama signed by many top tech firms including Apple, Google and Microsoft, and three of the five members of Obamas surveillance review group calling on the government to stop demanding the weakening of communications encryption, Ellen Nakashima reports for The Washington Post.


The State Department is aiming to have its review and public release of 55,000 pages of Hillary Clintons State Department emails done by January 2016, Politicos Josh Gerstein reports. Twelve staffers are working on the review.


The Republican National Committee is charging that Hillary Clintons lawyer, David Kendall, deceived Rep. Trey Gowdy, who is leading the Benghazi select committee, when he said that she did not use a second email address, hrdo17@clintonemail.com, citing newly reported emails released by the New York Times showing her use of it.


People are critical of Hillary Clinton on Twitter, and Politicos Annie Karni is ON IT.


Of the $11.7 million that Hillary Clinton made from 51 paid speeches since January 2014, more than one-quarter came from the tech sector, Matea Gold, Rosalind Helderman and Anu Narayanswamy report for The Washington Post.


Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has long been popular online, and as Nick Corasaniti of the New York Times reports, the reason is that he has the quirky sharing style of writing his own, often long, observations and quotations. Talk about the view from nowhere style of journalism: at no point in his well-reported story does Corasaniti consider the possibility that Sanders Facebook posts get hundreds of thousands of likes and often vault to the front page of Reddit because the ideas in themquestioning Americas huge military spending, making Election Day a national holiday, criticizing free trade agreementsare actually popular.


Its worth noting that if you went to the New York Times websites politics page this morning to try to find Corasanitis story, which got plenty of column inches in the print paper, youll have troubleits buried by the Times web editors in a More headlines section underneath several Hillary Clinton stories, including a listicle entitled 5 Things You Might Not Know About Hillary Clinton. (In case youre thinking that the Times is just doing this for clicks, consider the fact that since announcing his presidential candidacy, Sanders Facebook interactions have zoomed higher, three and four times higher than Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paulonline publishers should take note.)


The total number of Facebook interactions garnered by the UKs Conservative Party in the run up to the May elections there, as compared to the total collected by the Labour Party appears to mirror their actual vote ratio within +/- one percent, Mark Shephard of the University of Strathclyde reports.


Politicos Nancy Scola (yes, thats her new full-time gig) takes a deep dive look at how the US Digital Service is working to build a pipeline of tech talent to serve across government, using patriotic recruiting themes borrowed from the military. She notes that the hundreds of people coming in are limited to two-year postings, and thus how much any of the Administrations digital push will outlive his presidency, no one knows.


Related: White House CTO Megan Smith says that, pending approval from administration lawyers, she hopes to reach out to every campaign and make sure that everybody whos running knows about the work were doing, to ensure that whoever is the next president, theyll keep the governments new tech teams at the US Digital Service and 18F going, NextGovs Mohana Ravindranath reports.


The President of the United States has his own new Twitter account @POTUS, and as this visualization shows, the news spread fast yesterday. Heres more than you could possibly want to know about it, courtesy of Michael Shear of the New York Times.


Former White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer adds some background to the news, explaining on Medium why it wasnt enough for Obama to communicate through the @WhiteHouse Twitter account.


Can an agency Twitter account be equated to a paid lobbyist? The head of the National Association of Home Builders thinks so. He, along with other industry heads, is criticizing the EPA for using social media, in conjunction with the Sierra Club and Organizing for Action, to promote its proposed clean water rule, report Eric Lipton and Coral Davenport for the New York Times. The effort, which was led by a former Obama 2012 media operative, Thomas Reynolds, used Thunderclap to reach 1.8 million people, along with blog posts and other social media. But its not clear the EPA broke the federal anti-lobbying statute, which prevents government agencies from urging the public to pressure their elected representatives, since the campaignwhich was pushing against industry efforts to #ditchtherule, was aimed at getting people to submit public comments to the agency about it.


In The New Yorker (yes!), technosociologist Zeynep Tufekci reflects on how the rise of the internet changed her life as a young woman growing up in Turkey.


The city of Boston is tracking tweets and users who mention the citys @notifyboston account, reports Jordan Graham for the Boston Herald. According to the citys chief digital office, Lauren Lockwood, We use Twitter like a lot of places do, to push information to people but importantly to listen to them. We also look at sentiment analysis to try to figure out whats happening out there and what people are saying and how people feel.


Longtime readers know what I think of sentiment analysis. I think its amazing! (Can you tell what sentiment Im expressing?)


An academic study by Nicholas John and Shira Dvir-Gvirsman of slightly more than 1,000 Jewish-Israeli Facebook users found that during the 2014 Gaza war, people were more likely to unfriend or unfollow someone the further that user positioned themselves on either the left or right, and most of the people they disconnected from were weak ties, not close friends or family.


Writing in The Atlantic, danah boyd and Alex Rosenblat argue that requiring police to where body cameras may create more problems than it solves.

Jeb Bush isnt running for president, he says. Thats how he can legally raise millions in as-yet undisclosed dollars for his Super PAC, which is carrying out many of the activities of a typical presidential campaign at this stage in the race, as Nicholas Confessore and Eric Lichtblau report in the New York Times.


Nevertheless, when in Iowa Saturday, Bush told reporters that he was definitely going to compete for the states caucus-goers, saying, Why would I be here if I wasnt going to compete in Iowa? As Eli Stokols reports for Politico, Bush added, Whats relevant is running a campaign, creating a strategy, building a good team towards success, which is in the primaries, and doing it in a way that makes it possible to win the general, which is the whole point of this.


America Rising PAC, a conservative group founded by Matt Rhoades, Mitt Romneys campaign manager, is having success creating social media content attacking Hillary Clinton from the left and getting some progressives online to share it, Ashley Parker and Nick Corasaniti report for the New York Times.


The New York Times interactive team has built a nifty chart that lets you track the leading operatives from all the major presidential campaigns and their tangled trajectories from campaigns, PACs and party committees past to present.


Solomon Kahn, the head of the data team at PaperlessPost, has built a powerful, free new tool for visualizing who is funding Americas politicians that allows you to dig all the way down to the granular level. For example, he shows how his Congressman, Rep. Joe Crowley (D-MA), went from being heavily backed by labor to being heavily backed by finance, discovering the one day in 2007 when 14 people from the Blackstone Group maxed out on their donations to him. Hes raising money on Kickstarter now to help hire a communications strategist to get the word out. (h/t Lawrence Lessig)


Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) tweets, with a photo: Reading the FBI file on SCLC & myself, I am more convinced than ever that we cannot allow government surveillance.


With President Obama in Camden, NJ, today to talk about improving community policing, White House CTO Megan Smith and domestic policy assistant Roy Austin Jr. are rolling out an ambitious Police Data Initiative in partnership with 21 leading jurisdictions around the country. A volunteer tech team is doing a two-day design sprint with the Camden police department, kicking off a much larger effort to help update how cops use data that has a big emphasis, Smith and Austin write, on using open data to build transparency and increase community trust.

Blogger Scott Santens takes a long look at what happens when self-driving trucks eliminate millions of jobs, arguing that Just as our roads a decade from now will be full of machine drivers instead of human drivers, a 21st century economy shall be driven by human consumers, not human workers, and these consumers must be freely given their purchasing power. If we refuse, if we dont provide ourselves a universal and unconditional basic income soon, the future is going to hit us like a trucka truck driven solely by ourselves.

If you are frustrated with how your organization manages its technology tools, read this conversation between Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association digital consultant Sam Dorman and Greenpeace Mobilization Labs Michael Silberman. Dorman is onto something critical: the need to build a digital product team...to make sure your organization is using great, high-quality technology that is fully aligned with what youre trying to accomplish. This excerpt gives some flavor of what he means:
Most groups love their website on the day they launch it. But theres usually very little investment in it after that. And meanwhile, everything else is changing around it so every day the website gets a little bit farther and farther out of date. Eventually, the website becomes a huge source of frustration and embarrassment, and gets in the way of people doing their jobs. Then eventually you knock the whole thing down and spend a huge amount of time and money starting the whole cycle over again. The problem is, you only had this brief window of time where you actually loved your website and were getting good value from it! A product approach to the website is different. Instead of just letting it slip into decline, you admit that a website needs continued focus and continued resources in order to stay useful and relevant and secure, and even stylish. So yes, youre investing more in it, but at least you know it will continue to deliver much better value as your organization changes and the world changes around it. And then along the way you are fixing all of these points of frustration for staff and keeping the technology strong underneath.

The US House voted 338-88 for the USA Freedom Act, amending the Patriot Act to end the bulk collection of Americans phone metadata, Jennifer Steinhauer reports for The New York Times. Instead, that data would be held by private telcos, and the NSA or FBI would have to get the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to access it.


On Twitter, journalist Glenn Greenwald, who shared the Pulitzer Prize for exposing the NSAs surveillance programs, tweeted his praise for the news, saying First time since 9/11 that powers justified in the name of terrorism will be reduced rather than increased.


But CREDO Mobile, Demand Progress and Fight for the Future condemned the House members who backed the vote, saying that it wouldnt end mass surveillance and could actually provide legal immunity to companies that unlawfully provide the government with their customers information. Congress shouldnt reauthorize a surveillance program that a federal court just declared illegal. But the House voted to do just that by passing the USA Freedom Act which could provide legal authority to continue some of the surveillance practices the judiciary just struck down, said Becky Bond, Vice President of CREDO Mobile.


The ACLU says it still wants Section 215 of the Patriot Act to completely sunset, but that if the US Senate passes the USA Freedom Act, it should amend it to prevent surveillance of individuals with no nexus to terrorism, to ensure that irrelevant information is not held but immediately purged, and to add a public advocate role before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Sen. Rand Pauls (R-KY) presidential campaign wants to be known as the the only one with a tech advisory board, a CTO, a digital strategist, and offices in both San Francisco and Austin, Texas, reports Ellen Cushing for Buzzfeed, who didnt manage to get the candidate to answer any questions at a tech event he did in San Francisco this past Saturday.


Paul had to pay $100,000 to get RandPaul.com, CNNs Jeremy Diamond  reported last week.


Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) got his BernieSanders.com for free from a supporter, Paul Joffe, who had paid $2,500 to grab it back in 2014all Joffe wanted in return was to meet the Senator, CNNs Dan Merica reports.

With billionaire-funded presidential Super Pacs becoming the norm for most of the 2016 field, Peter Beinart writes in the Atlantic that journalists should step up their scrutiny:

Mega-donors should face a version of the same tradeoff politicians face. Presidential candidates know that in exchange for pursuing immense political power, they must forfeit much of their privacy. Mega-donors, who are also seeking immense political power via their donations, should have to make the same trade. Journalists should not only investigate their interactions with politicians, they should ferret out information about what they believe and how they conduct their affairs.

Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows the collection of phone records deemed relevant to a national security case, cannot be interpreted to mean that it authorizes the collection of all Americans phone records, a three-judge appeals court has unanimously ruled, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Weisman report for the New York Times. It remains to be seen how this ruling will affect the ongoing debate in Congress about reauthorizing the act.


National insecurity blogger Marcy Wheeler catches Senate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr sharing the previously undisclosed fact that the bulk data collection program doesnt only capture phone numbers, it also vacuums up IP addresses.


Big news from Facebookistan: Data scientists Eytan Bakshy, Solomon Messing and Lada Adamic have published a new peer-reviewed paper in Science that studied how 10.1 million adult US Facebook users interact with socially shared news, finding that self-identified liberals and conservatives do tend to cluster together and mostly share ideologically-consistent content, but that both groups also frequently encounter cross-cutting content. Bakshy et al. also find that while the News Feed algorithm definitely reduces the amount of cross-cutting content such users see, their own individual choices about what to click on has a somewhat larger role. In other words, the authors admit the filter bubble exists, but peoples bubbles overlap and to the degree partisan polarization is happening on Facebook, its more the fault of users than it is of the algorithm.


In the New York Times, Farhad Manjoo does an admirable job of summarizing the study and the debate that it has sparked, considering that he is writing for the Business section of the New York Times. (Most of Americas mainstream media walks very gingerly around critical reporting of Facebook and News Feed, given that the social network giant sits like a jovial overweight mob boss on their jugular vein, able to choke their online traffic at whim, or even by accident. Nice news business you have there...it would be a shame if anything happened to it.)


Eli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy and the author of the book The Filter Bubble, comments on Medium that Facebooks effort to downplay its algorithms sorting power is an overstatement. He adds, Certainly, who your friends are matters a lot in social media. But the fact that the algorithms narrowing effect is nearly as strong as our own avoidance of views we disagree with suggests that its actually a pretty big deal.


Technosociologist Zeynep Tufekci says the most important finding in the study is buried in an appendix that shows that the News Feed algorithm has tremendous power in affecting what users will actually click on. The higher the link, more (a lot more) likely it will be clicked on. You live and die by placement, determined by the newsfeed algorithm, she writes. (And Facebook continues to deny that it exercises editorial power, as Jay Rosen reminds us.) Tufecki also attacks Bakshy et al. for in effect trying to hide a new finding, that the News Feed algorithm reduces ideological diversity, behind an old, well-established finding, that people have a tendency to avoid content that challenges their beliefs.


University of Michigan information studies professor Christian Sandvig sums all this criticism up well, saying that the framing of the researchers findings suggest this should be referred to as Facebooks Its not our fault study. Plus, he (like Pariser and Tufekci) adds several important qualifiersmost important being that this is not a random study of all Facebook users, but ones of heavy users who self-report their political views on Facebook, something only 4 percent do in a way the researchers found interpretable.


In Crooked Timber, Eszter Hargittai rips the editors of Science for letting the Facebook researchers make broad and conclusive claims about such an unrepresentative sample.


Sandvig also notes the larger context:

Facebook is a private corporation with a terrible public relations problem. It is periodically rated one of the least popular companies in existence. It is currently facing serious government investigations into illegal practices in many countries, some of which stem from the manipulation of its news feed algorithm. In this context, I have to say that it doesnt seem wise for these Facebook researchers to have spun these data so hard in this direction, which I would summarize as: the algorithm is less selective and less polarizing. Particularly when the research finding in their own study is actually that the Facebook algorithm is modestly more selective and more polarizing than living your life without it.


Why this matters: University of Maryland media theorist and Snapchat researcher Nathan Jurgenson adds: Power and control are most efficiently maintained when they are made invisible. Facebooks ideological push to dismiss the very real ways they structure what users see and do is the company attempting to simultaneously embrace control and evade responsibility. Their news team doesnt need to be competent in journalism because they dont see themselves as doing journalism. But Facebook is doing journalism, and the way they code their algorithms and the rest of the site is structuring and shaping personal, social, and civic life. Like it or not, weve collectively handed very important civic roles to social media companies, the one I work for included, and a real danger is that we cant hope for them to be competent at these jobs when they wont even admit to doing them.


A footnote: Two of the authors of this study, Solomon Messing and Eytan Bakshy, are also responsible for Facebooks still unreleased study of the impact of changing the News Feed content for close to 2 million adult American users in the ten weeks leading up to the 2012 election (putting more hard news at the top of their feeds), increasing their interest in government and self-reported tendency to vote by 3 percent. Heres the story I did for Mother Jones last October on that. When I started asking Messing and Bakshy about two public talks their third colleague Lada Adamic had given about this fascinating intervention in the 2012 election, they moved quickly to have a video of one of Adamics talks removed from YouTube (I kept a copy here). According to Adamic, in that experiment, Messing tweaked the feeds of those users so that instead of seeing your regular news feed, if any of your friends had shared a news story, [Messing] would boost that news story so that it was up top [on your page] and you were much more likely to see it. A Facebook spokesman, Michael Buckley, told me that this study helped influence decisions inside Facebook to increase the hard news content of users News Feeds. Now that we have further confirmation from Facebook itself that the placement of items in News Feed is a powerful signal, plus the evidence that it can demonstrably increase voter participation, its time that Facebook opened itself up to independent engineering audits to ensure that its tweaking of the News Feed algorithm is actually random, blind, and politically neutral.


City Paper reporter Emily Guendelsberger went undercover as an UberX driver in Philadelphia and discovered that she made about $9.34 an hour, meaning that working ten hours a day, six days a week shed net almost $30,000 a year before taxes. Some life!


Why do todays tech oligarchs repeatedly cite those fishermen off the coast of Africa who use their mobile phones to find the market with the best price to sell their catch as proof that high-tech isnt mainly helping a new class of super-rich get richer? That quote could have been from Facebooks Mark Zuckerbergs defense earlier this week of Internet.org, but actually is from Googles executive chairman Eric Schmidt and his Google Ideas sidekick Jared Cohen, writing in the Huffington Post about how data science and machine learning will enable computers to move beyond their current role as our assistants, and become our advisors. Its the kind of exciting vision one can only have from the vantage point that sees the coast of Africa as some kind of unitary place.

Mitchell Baker, the CEO of the Mozilla Foundation, takes a close look at zero rating and explains clearly why it is a threat to the open internet. One half of zero rating (which is what Facebook is doing with Internet.org) is helping cover data charges for poor users, which she lauds. The other half, where the parts of the internet that are available for citizens to choose from is limited, and predetermined by those entities with financial power, Baker says is disastrous. She notes that yesterday Mozilla wrote to Prime Minister Modi of India supporting the open internet and stating that zero rating is not the right solution.


Mozilla Corporations senior VP for business and legal affairs Denelle Dixon-Thayer points out that there are alternatives to the Facebook Internet.org approach. She notes that in Bangladesh, a Mozilla partnership with Grameenphone allows users to receive 20MB of free data usage a day in exchange for viewing an ad, for example.


Related: Mozilla staffer Ben Moskowitz writes that Internet.org is offensive. Instead, he says,

Internet.org is neither the Internet, nor a charitable and development-oriented .org. Internet.org is now a carefully managed partnership program, through which Facebook has curatorial power similar to an app store.


And Josh Levy of Access writes in Wired that we should actually refer to Internet.org as Facebooknet.


Writing in The Guardian, imprisoned whistleblower Chelsea Manning makes an impassioned case for increased freedom of information. She writes, I believe that when the public lacks even the most fundamental access to what its governments and militaries are doing in their names, then they cease to be involved in the act of citizenship.


Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has hired Revolution Messaging the lead his digital efforts, bringing on several veterans of Barack Obamas 2008 campaign, including RM founder Scott Goodstein (external online director for Obama 08 and the one-time keeper of @barackobama), Arun Chaudhary (new media road director in 08 and Obamas first official White House videographer), Shauna Daly (Obama 08 deputy research director), and Walker Hamilton (site architect for Obama 08). Kenneth Pennington, Sanders Senate social media director, is also joining the team. According to a release from Revolution Messaging, the Sanders campaign raised $3 million in its first four days, outperforming the current Republican field with 75,000 contributions averaging $43 each. 185,000 supporters have signed up at BernieSanders.com.


So far, Hillary Clintons campaign has released little information about its fundraising. And as Patrick Caldwell reports for Mother Jones, it also has yet to say anything about what it will reveal about its bundlers, those key individuals who frequently round up hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars in contributions on behalf of campaigns. The 2008 Clinton campaign released limited information about its bundlers, only offering a list of 324 people who pulled in $100,000 or more. The Obama campaign that year offered a more detailed list of 556 names broken into four monetary tiers. The 2012 Romney campaign released no bundler information.


With voters in Great Britain going to the polls, the BBCs Mike Wendling chews on that old bone, the so-called social media election (aka the Facebook election or the Twitter election etc.luckily here in the US were onto the Meerkat election). Far more likely its a data and analytics election, but so far weve seen little coverage of that critical element in digital campaigning.

Writing in NonProfit Quarterly, William Schambra of the Hudson Institutes Bradley Center for Philanthropy and Civic Renewal takes a sledgehammer to Laura Arrillaga-Andreessens stated belief that technology is in the nascent states of completely transforming philanthropy. Contrary to her assertion that technology is forcing the entire social sector to be more accountable and transparent about how every single one of our gifts is tangibly transforming individual lives, Schambra says that Human problems will not suddenly be solved by the clever flashes of out-of-the-box imagination so prized by technology and he calls for a a larger nonprofit insurgency against high-tech imperialism. And this: For too long...we have listened passively to insulting and patronizing lectures by the tech titans about the expansiveness of their vision compared to the timidity of ours, the efficacy of their tools compared to the crudeness of ours. Tell us how you really feel!


Commenting on Schambras rant, Inside Philanthropys David Callahan offers a semi-rebuttal, outlining Five Big Myths About Techies and Philanthropy. One choice bit:

Looking across tech philanthropy, I would say these funders are only marginally more interested in technology than other funders. In fact, over the past few months, Ive heard a lot more from legacy foundation leaders like Darren Walker about technology than anyone from Silicon Valley, and the big push in philanthropy on net neutrality has mainly come from those traditional funders. One of them, the Knight Foundation, is more infatuated with technology that any Silicon Valley foundation I know of.


Keynoting the Re:publica conference in Berlin yesterday, Ethan Zuckerman of the MIT Center of Civic Media gave a typically wonderful and broad-ranging talk about civics in the age of mistrust that is also a meditation on what we have gotten wrong about the internets potential to change politics for the better.


Taking a half-page from John Olivers advice to Edward Snowden on how to get Americans to care about the NSAs surveillance overreaching, Fight for the Future is calling on supporters to post pictures of themselves naked from the waist up, using the hashtag #IFEELNAKED to make Congress ashamed theyre watching us. The results are impressive. FFTF is also asking websites to install code that will prevent anyone from a Congressional IP address from seeing their sites, instead getting a splash page reading Stop Invading Our Private Lives.


Speaking of privacy innovations, the ACLU is trying to find out what kind of overhead surveillance city and federal authorities were conducting last week in Baltimore, after a random Twitter exchange between a resident and a local aviation buff unearthed some very curious data about a Cessna that kept flying over the West Baltimore epicenter of the protests, Craig Timberg reports for The Washington Post.

The Democratic National Committee announced yesterday that it will host six presidential primary debates, starting this fall, working with a combination of state Democratic Parties, national broadcast media, digital platforms, local media, and civic organizations.

The Republican National Committee debate process, which calls for nine sanctioned debates, appears to have a similar exclusivity rule.

Responding to criticism of its Internet.org program in India, Facebook announced that it is opening it to more sites and services. Chris Daniels, VP of product for Internet.org, tells Pranav Dixit of the Hindustan Times: Sites and services that are part of the Internet.org platform will need to adhere to three principles: they need to offer a simpler version of their existing service to encourage people go out and explore the broader internet. They will also need to be extremely data efficient because this has to work for [telecom] operators. It cant be a constraint on their networks. So things like video or high-resolution photos arent going to be appropriate for this. He adds, some access is better than no access.


Developers will have to apply for their services to be included in Internet.org, something no one has to do on the real internet. But in Facebooks video announcing the move, Mark Zuckerberg argues that this doesnt contradict net neutrality, condemning his critics as people who put the intellectual purity of technology above peoples needs. (Its tempting to compare Zuckerbergs impassioned speech in this video to the lese majeste tone of Bill Gates letter to his fellow computer hobbyists back in 1976, condemning them for copying and sharing Microsofts software without paying for it.)


Responding to the move, Nikhil Pahwa, a volunteer with SavetheInternet.in, writes that this is still a fundamental, permanent change in the way the Internet works, and that Internet.org is a privacy nightmare because Facebook, your telecom operator and the government will know what you are doing.


Secure content is not currently supported by Internet.org, but according to this exchange between Open Whisper Systems Frederic Jacobs and Mark Zuckerberg, its coming.


Two of the central Twitter activists at the heart of the new civil rights movement, DeRay Mckesson and Netta Elzie, are profiled in next Sundays New York Times magazine by Jay Caspian Kang. The story nicely illustrates some of the online network-weaving that they do constantly, and pushes back gently against the desire of many, older civil rights veterans for charismatic leaders to articulate the movements demands. Oddly though, the piece makes no mention of the origins of the #BlackLivesMatter movement in the wake of the acquittal of Trayvon Martins killer in 2012, leaving the impression that todays wave of activism started this past summer with #Ferguson and the killing of Mike Brown.


In response to the story, Clay Shirky tweets: it seems like just yesterday when Malcolm @Gladwell insisted social media would be largely useless in civic rights campaigns.


John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, takes to Medium to announce a new hub called The Briefing that will provide the public with direct access to the facts about Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, and which will be accompanied by a suite of co-branded social media platformsfrom Twitter to Vine, YouTube to Facebook. Mark me as still curious why the Clinton campaign website doesnt have a blog for these kinds of announcements. Surely they want the traffic and the metadata that comes with it?

Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina makes her presidential bid official with a tweet this morning. Her online footprint: 357,000 Twitter followers and only about 43,000 on Facebook.


Former colleagues of Fiorina at HP say she mishandled the companys $25 billion acquisition of Compaq and put her own self-promotion first, report Rory Carroll and Rupert Neate for The Guardian. She put herself ahead of the the interests of the company and I fear she would do the same as president, Jason Burnett, a member of the Packard Foundations board of trustees, told them.


The editorial board of the San Jose Mercury News, which watched Fiorinas first bid for public office when she ran for Senate in 2010, says She takes the Silicon Valley motto that its OK to fail a tad too literally.


On Facebook, retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson is also making his presidential candidacy official. His online footprint there is bigger than Hillary Clintons at 1.2 million; he also has 326,000 followers on Twitter.


Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders raised $1.5 million in the first day after his presidential campaign announcement, with an average donation of $43, Greg Sargent reports for the Washington Post. Sanders money quote: Can I raise a billion dollars? Probably not. But the question is, can I raise enough money to run a grass roots campaign and utilize millions of people? I think we can raise that kind of money.


So far Hillary Clintons campaign hasnt released any details of its early fundraising haul. This story by Glenn Thrush and Anna Palmer in Politico describes the complications involved in putting together a billion-dollar-plus fundraising machine, complete with the competing desires of growing a large, flat structure of many maxed-out individuals giving $2,700 and the much more traditional approach of empowering mega-donors on the East and West coasts and revving up the Priorities USA Action Super PAC.


Sanders has long been a critic of the NSAs mass surveillance programs, reports Dustin Volz for National Journal.


Reporting from London on this weeks upcoming national elections in Britain, Ben Smith of Buzzfeed contrasts the way Britains conservative print titans are bashing Labor Party challenger Ed Miliband with the love being lavished on him by the Internets meme-makers and the million-plus YouTube views his interview with radical Russell Brand has earned.

Given that TV and radio advertising are prohibited in British elections, it makes sense that all the parties contending for power in the United Kingdom are using social media to rally voters, as Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura details for The New York Times. Her story doesnt offer much info on what the campaigns are doing with email or with voter targeting, which as readers know from the American elections, are where real differences in capacity may matter.


Even, a prototype app to help low-wage workers with unsteady cash incomes better manage their money, gets a lush write-up in Sundays New York Times Magazine from Anand Giridharadas.

Hello, world! Today we are launching Civicist, our hub for news and analysis of the civic tech world, with a gorgeous new design. And that means we are going to mothball techPresident (keeping all its content accessible), and convert First Post into Civicists daily news aggregator. For those of you who get First Post by morning email (a benefit of being a Civic Hall member), all that will change is next week, these emails will start coming from a new email address). And well keep sharing First Post online later in the day, but it will now go up on the Civicist site.


Were excited to launch Civicist with a diverse group of contributing editors, including Hollie Russon Gilman, Erhardt Graeff, Marci Harris, Mark Headd, Allyson Kapin, David Karpf, Laurenellen McCann, An Xioa Mina, David Moore, Antonella Napolitano, Matt Stempeck, Anthony Townsend, and Ethan Zuckerman. To kick off our coverage, weve asked them to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? and will be publishing their responses this week and next.


For starters, here is Laurenellen McCann on But What is Civic?, Mark Headd on The Last Mile of Service Delivery, Hollie Russon Gilman on Civic Tech: Empowering the 21st Century Public (Maybe), and Matt Stempeck on A Maddeningly Broad Term.


For more on what Civicist will do, read this. Follow us also @civicist.


Its not often that the tech sector rolls out a new product that may actually change the world, but I will make an exception for the new Tesla home/business battery launch. It will allow solar home owners and electric car owners to substantially withdraw from the grid and quite possibly tip the oil/gas/coal sector towards historys dustbin. Futurist Ramez Naam argues that the economics are almost there.


Nearly two years after Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the US governments massive surveillance programs, Congress is on the verge of major reforms of the Patriot Act, report Jonathan Weisman and Jennifer Steinhauer for The New York Times. They note that The Snowden disclosures, along with data breaches at Sony Pictures, Target and the insurance giant Anthem, have unsettled voters and empowered those in Congress arguing for greater civil liberties protectionwho a few years ago could have met in a couple of phone booths, said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.


Snowdens name appears seven times in that front-page story, in fact. A petition on the White Houses We the People site calling on the Obama administration to pardon him, which has 166,771 signatures, has been waiting for a formal response for 22 months.


The House Government Oversight and Reform Committees information technology subcommittee actually has two members with computer science degrees on it, and during a hearing this week they made clear they arent buying the governments arguments for backdoor access to encrypted communications, Andrea Peterson reports for the Washington Post. It is clear to me that creating a pathway for decryption only for good guys is technologically stupid, said one of them, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA). You Just cant do that.


Cory Doctorow, a longtime critic of the so-called backdoor key approach, attacks U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron for pushing the idea, writing in The Guardian that:

Making it possible for the state to open your locks in secret means that anyone who works for the state, or anyone who can bribe or coerce anyone who works for the state, can have the run of your life. Cryptographic locks dont just protect our mundane communications: cryptography is the reason why thieves cant impersonate your fob to your cars keyless ignition system; its the reason you can bank online; and its the basis for all trust and security in the 21st century.


Matt Taibbi writes in Rolling Stone that Senator Bernie Sanders presidential campaign should be taken seriously, attacking the mainstream medias focus on early money-raising. He writes: Were conditioned to believe that the candidate who has the early assent of a handful of executives on Wall Street and in Hollywood and Silicon Valley is the serious politician, while the one who is merely the favorite of large numbers of human beings is an irritating novelty act whose only possible goal could be to cut into the numbers of the real players.


As Twitters stock tanks, longtime media analyst Mathew Ingram argues that the company made a critical mistake five years ago when it started cannibalizing and shutting down the third-party developer network that had helped it initially grow, and that it should have become more open and decentralized, not less.


While Sridhar Ramamswamy, Googles senior VP of ads and commerce, is writing here in the Wall Street Journal about how mobile internet use is changing consumer behavior, pitching his argument to commercial brands, everything he says also applies to politics and causes. To wit:

These moments, or micro-moments, are when we act on a needto learn something, do something, discover something, watch something or buy something. They are intent-rich moments where decisions are being made and preferences being shaped. We see them constantly, across billions of monthly searches, billions of hours of videos watched every month, billions of interactions with various sites and apps. These arent just people inattentively tapping things into their phone; they rather are the new battleground for hearts, minds and, with them, the dollars their attention brings along.This is a pretty seismic change for advertisers.

There will be a Democratic presidential primary: Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has announced formally that he is running for president. Compared to Hillary Clinton, he enters the field with a much smaller digital footprint: 294,000 Twitter followers (and thats to his official Senate accounthis official personal campaign account has just 11,600) to her 3.45 million; and 301,000 likes on Facebook compared to her 787,000. Still, Sanders economic populist message may give him surprising tractionfor years he has successfully appealed to many of his states more conservative and independent voters despite being an avowed socialist. It will be interesting to see if the mainstream media, which has essentially anointed Clinton the Democratic nominee, gives Sanders a fair shake, and also how the new media ecosystem, which has made more room for previously ignored or suppressed voices, responds to his campaign.


With Section 215 of the Patriot Act due to sunset on June 1, the Senate appears increasingly likely to pass the USA Freedom Act, ending most authority for bulk data surveillance of Americans, writes Greg Sargent for the Washington Post.


Related: Slovakias constitutional court has ruled that the mass surveillance of citizens under the countrys Electronic Communications Act is unconstitutional.


If you are trying to make sense of the raw real-time information that surges through your feeds during a live event, Anthony de Rosa of Wired offers a great set of tools to help separate fact from rumor.


David Simon on why the Freddie Gray death has been a huge catalyst for protests in Baltimore, interviewed by the Marshall Projects Bill Keller:

Because the documented litany of police violence is now out in the open. Theres an actual theme here thats being made evident by the digital revolution. It used to be our word against yours. It used to be said  correctly  that the patrolman on the beat on any American police force was the last perfect tyranny. Absent a herd of reliable witnesses, there were things he could do to deny you your freedom or kick your ass that were between him, you, and the street. The smartphone with its small, digital camera, is a revolution in civil liberties.


Observing the tightening relationship between big legacy news publishers and the giant platforms (read: Google, Facebook) through which many people now get their news, Columbia Universitys Emily Bell writes in the Columbia Journalism Review that  no one really knows where this new, closer partnership approach is leading. But then she offers a hint, quoting Kara Swisher of Re/code, speaking of how the platforms will likely behave: They will pet you, then later on, when you are dependent on their traffic, they will start charging you. Its a bad idea.


If you spend a lot of time worrying about your organizations list size, open rates and web traffic, you arent really getting a real measure of your members engagement, argues veteran progressive online strategist Colin Holtz. Hes the author, with advisors Jackie Mahendra and Michael Silberman, of a major new report on how to get past these vanity metrics produced for Greenpeaces Mobilisation Lab and the Citizen Engagement Lab. Heres a sampling of their findings:
Right now, our metrics bias us towards recruiting the most new members, not the right new members.
You can increase actions taken just by sending lots and lots of petitions with little substance.


People engage in all sorts of tactics that hit short term goals at the cost of long-term engagement.


This is civic tech: Natural disasters have been rallying points for distributed networks of online helpers ever since Hurricane Katrina and the People Finder Project, and the Nepal earthquake is no exception. This post by Arun Ganesh of Mapbox details the amazing collaborative effort unfolding on OpenStreetMap, where more than 2,000 volunteer mappers have added tremendous detail to Nepals mapsfour times as many that pitched in after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.


The Kathmandu Living Labs adds more details from its situation room in Nepals capital.


Writing for TechCrunch, Omidyar Networks Stacy Donohue says that civic techwhich she defines as any technology that is used to empower citizens or help make government more accessible, efficient and effectiveis at a break-out point for investors and entrepreneurs.
Lisa Abeyta, the founder of APPCityLife, writes in the Huffington Post that for urban civic tech to take off, more cities are going to have to make their procurement policies a lot more flexible, pointing to Citymart as one company that is having success disrupting the procurement process itself (Citymart is based in the U.S. at Civic Hall.)


The new round of winners of the Knight Foundations Prototype Fund include several civic and political projects: Ballot by WeVote, Neighborhood Drawing Tool by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, Open Permit by Aecosoft Corp., She said, he said, by Open Media Foundation, and Troll-Busters by Michelle Ferrier. Winners all receive $35,000 grants.


The New Republic has added five advisory board members, reports Joe Pompeo for Capital NY, including Jay Rosen of NYU.

More people say they regularly get news about politics and government from Facebook than from CNN or Fox News, the new Pew Research Center annual journalism survey reports. In the last week, 48 percent of adults surveyed said they got such news from Facebook, compared to 44 percent for CNN, 39 percent for Fox, and just 9 percent from Twitter.


Another more surprising finding from the survey: 24 percent of adults say they use Google Plus vs. just 21 percent for Twitter. Facebook users are more likely to say they get political news from that service than Twitter users (62 percent vs. 40 percent). So-called consistent liberals are somewhat more likely to say they get news from Facebook or Twitter, compared to consistent conservatives.


Complicating the filter bubble theory, among those people who pay attention to posts about government and politics on Facebook, the large majority75 percentsay that the posts they see are in line with their views only some of the time or not too often. But people who are consistently liberal or conservative are more likely to say the posts they see are indeed always or mostly in line with their views47 percent of consistent conservatives say so and 32 percent of liberals. Similarly, those two groups are more likely to block others they disagree with, with 44 percent of consistent liberals saying they have done so and 31 percent of consistent conservatives. So, some self-sorting by ideology is going on, but its not clear whether the trend is getting stronger (as this anecdotal story by Nick Corsaniti in the New York Times suggests, saying that the intensifying presidential election conversation is leading more people to unfollow people they disagree with), or not.


In 2014, false information about Ebola and Obamacare on Twitter outnumbered factually correct information by an overall ratio of three to one, finds a new study by Andrew Guess of Columbia University for the American Press Institute.


According to this report by Sam Brodey and Jenna McLaughlin for Mother Jones, yesterdays riots in Baltimore didnt start with social media spreading word of a crime-spree purge, but with police apparently charged up by those rumors stopping busses full of students on their way, corralling them, and then marching on them.


Media analyst Jonathan Albright delves into how journalists covering the live events in Baltimore have used Twitters Periscope app to good effect. (Everything about his piece is great except the notion that, in the age of Livestream and UStream, sharing live news video is somehow new.)


Finally, someone says the obvious: Whether its the new Apple Watch or the latest company IPO, no one in tech journalism really knows where anything is going. So says Mat Honan, Buzzfeeds San Francisco bureau chief. He writes, Anyone who pretends to know the future is fooling you. Or themself. We are barely muddling our way through the present.


Vermonts independent Senator Bernie Sanders is planning to officially announce on Thursday that he is running for president as a Democrat, Alan Rappeport reports for the New York Times.


Jamia Wilson, the executive director of Women, Action & the Media, which is doing leading-edge work fighting online harassment, talks to Tom Watson about the power of networked feminism. (Forbes, which has published columns by Watson for three years, took this column down, leading Watson to post it on Medium and announce that he was ending his relationship with Forbes.)


Our bright shiny future: Writing for Mediums Backchannel, Alex Howard reports on a new wave of cheap but highly effective medical devices, many of them coming out of MITs Little Devices lab, that are starting to revolutionize health care, especially for the poor.


Bright and shiny, cont.: Stretch your mind forward into the near future with David Roberts of Vox.com, who starts his tenure there with a great post about where solar energy is going: Imagine urban infrastructure in which wireless charging is everywherein curbs, benches, and busesin which all electric devices are always being charged with sunlight thats always being collected and stored. Energy distribution could effectively become ambient.Just as we expect all our devices to be connected to the internet today, uploading and downloading information, in the future we may expect all our devices and structures to be connected to this distributed energy net, harvesting, storing, and sharing the suns power.

BaltimoreUprising.org is one hub for information about the protests against police violence in Baltimore.


This data journalism story from last Septembers Baltimore Sun catalogues the many cases where the city has paid out settlements to residents beaten by police.


Riots in Baltimore yesterday began with word spreading on social media of a purge, according to The Baltimore Suns Justin Fenton and Erica Green, a reference to a movie where crime becomes legal.


Baltimore Orioles COO John Angelos connects the dots in a very different way, in a series of tweets summarized here on USA Today. The key lines, after he condemns the riots:
...my greater source of personal concern, outrage and sympathy beyond this particular case is focused neither upon one nights property damage nor upon the acts, but is focused rather upon the past four-decade period during which an American political elite have shipped middle class and working class jobs away from Baltimore and cities and towns around the U.S. to third-world dictatorships like China and others, plunged tens of millions of good, hard-working Americans into economic devastation, and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every Americans civil rights protections in order to control an unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state.



Caitlin Dewey of the Washington Post draws on the work of SocialFlow data scientist Gilad Lotan to explain why #FreddieGray hasnt trended nationally on Twitter, as of yet.


Body cameras on police officers are coming, but as Robinson Meyer reports for The Atlantic, theres little agreement about their usefulness. As Emily Shaw of the Sunlight Foundation tells him, while the footage collected is very clearly a public interest record, such videos are also just full of private information.


Three of the most justifiably paranoid people in the world, Ai Weiwei, Laura Poitras and Jacob Applebaum, meet up in Beijing to make an art project for Rhizome, and Fusions Kashmir Hill is there to document the event.


A group of American whistleblowers including Daniel Ellsberg and Thomas Drake announced their support for the Surveillance State Repeal Act, Dan Froomkin of The Intercept reports.


Security expert Bruce Schneier says its time for the FBI to stop suppressing coverage of the Stingray cell phone interception tool being used by various law enforcement agencies, especially since amateurs and criminals can make their own  and that the real issue is that our cell phone networks are too vulnerable in the first place.


A new bill introduced by Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) would increase the penalties for cyber criminals who obtain information from a protected computer without authorization. Zack Whittaker of ZDNet writes that this new bill directly counters Aarons Law, which aims to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to take into account non-malicious Internet activities.


Self-described #ClintonMan Tom Watson, an expert on philanthropy, uses his Forbes.com column to defend the Clinton Foundation, stating that In the world of big American philanthropy, the Clinton Foundation is remarkably transparent. He also says that it should come under greater scrutiny than most other U.S. charities given its past, present and future connections to government.


Yesterday, Mike Allen of Politico highlighted the fact that Per Facebook, the video of Obamas Anger Translator bit from Saturdays [White House Correspondents Association] dinner has been viewed 25 million times, calling it HOT ONLINE. I beg to differ. This is a vastly inflated number, since Facebook actually counts a video view...as a view of three seconds or more...including those that come to life as people scroll through News Feed. A much more relevant number is how many times the video has been liked (488,000 times as of this morning) or shared (665,000). Facebook now says the video has gotten 31 million viewsbut the number of likes its gotten only increased about 58,000 since yesterday.


Compared to the George W. Bush Foundation, the Clinton Foundation is more transparent in disclosing all of its donors, Peter Overby and Domenico Montanaro report for NPR. The Bush Foundation just lists its corporate backers with no amounts included.


NY political journalist Errol Louis says in the Daily News that we shouldnt define corruption down, writing that Hillary Clintons defenders simply say the slippery mix of money, shmoozing and private promises exchanged with foreign players doesnt constitute a crime.We can surely do better. It should be unthinkable for a candidate for the Oval Office to accept money from foreign sources, and voters should never miss an opportunity to say soto pollsters, to candidates and most of all to each other.


Veteran tech strategist and promoter Sylvia Paull reminds us that if billionaires like those being minted by the tech industry just paid all their workers, including those doing low-end service jobs, a much higher salary, they wouldnt be as rich but then the foundations they endow wouldnt have to dole out so much charity.

See if you can parse these two quotes, that literally follow each other, from Steven Levys fascinating interview with Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley, who is building a personalized geo-location layer for the Internet:


Crowley: We can figure out, for instance that this person who plays Clash of Clans, plays at the bus station and the coffee shop and has also been to these other spots. So those folks can get ads that are slightly more targeted to them.Levy: Some people think its creepy that an app passively logs everywhere they go.Crowley: People ask me about the privacy things all the time. I dont want people to think that were being creepyI want to expose this, so I can say if you carry this thing in your pocket, you get smarter. We understand where youve been, but we dont share it with anyone.

It looks like last years successful campaign to defend net neutrality just claimed a collateral win: as Jonathan Mahler writes in the New York Times, regulators attitudes toward the proposed, now sunk, Comcast-TimeWarner merger were shaped by fears that the combined company would be too big. At the end of the day, he writes, the governments commitment to maintaining a free and open Internet did not square with the prospect of a single company controlling as much as 40 percent of the publics access to it.


Harold Feld of Public Knowledge goes deep on why the FCC balked at the Comcast-TimeWarner deal.


House Speaker John Boehner tells Bloombergs Mark Halperin that the House might subpoena Hillary Clintons personal email server if she doesnt turn it over for independent investigation. Said Boehner:
She violated the law, and the idea that she was going to use her own server and do official business on it goes against every transparency issue that the President likes to tout. At some point, they just cant ignore the fact that there are a lot of public documents on this server that the American people have a right to see. And we believe that its time for Mrs. Clinton to turn that server and all those documents over to the IG, the Inspector General, at the State Department.



Todays must-read: Top Republican social media strategist Vincent Harris gets a big fat plug from Austin-based freelancer Tom Bartlett in Politico Magazine, in the course of a long and somewhat confused feature story on how the GOP is still trying to catch up to Dems in the use of tech and data. Last fall, Harris switched from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) in the presidential sweepstakes, and his teams success getting candidates to use the latest social media tools is highlighted throughout the story. Also featured in Bartletts story: veteran Republican strategists Patrick Ruffini, Mindy Finn and Chuck DeFeo, and ex-GOPer Katie Harbath, now at Facebook.


One sign that Bartlett doesnt quite get the role of tech in winning campaigns is this sentence: To beat [Hillary Clinton]  or whomever the Democratic Party picks as its nomineethe GOP is going to need an adventurous candidate whos willing to wade into uncharted online waters, be it Meerkat or whatever next years hot new thing turns out to be... Yeah, whatever. Its a Meerkat election. (Bartlett also mistakenly reports that Clintons self-advertised plan to build a tech team of 1,000 would make it three times larger than Obamas in 2012 when in fact he had close to 500 staff working on tech.)


No surprise here: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wants Hillary Clinton to be president, Bloomberg Politics Emily Greenhouse reports.


Jacob Harris of The New York Times, a founding member of its Interactive Newsroom Technologies team, is leaving to go work for 18F. On the way out, he shares a great story about when the web people like him were finally allowed into the newsroom, at the beginning of the 2008 presidential election season, because there was a vast hidden world of data we were missing.


Googles chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, says strong encryption without so-called backdoors is necessary to keep the authorities accountable, reports Tom Simonite for Technology Review.

Hes also announcing that his office is the first state government member of our very own Civic Hall.
