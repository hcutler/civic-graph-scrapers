        <Explanation>Successful businesses thrive in healthy communities, and many organizations, like John Knox Village, are challenging themselves to determine how their community involvement efforts can make an even greater impact. And while businesses play a critical role in local communities through monetary donations to various causes and organizations, it's the power of the people - our skills and talents - that really make a difference. We want to share our expertise to make a positive impact within the multiple communities that Village associates and residents live, work, worship, volunteer, etc. It's not only the right thing to do - it's a business strategy that means success for our organization. John Knox Village is dedicated to helping to build stronger and more vibrant communities. It is a commitment we live out each day as part of our mission of "Enriching lives, building community" for our residents and associates. This tenet involves more than just the people who live and work at John Knox Village; it includes the people and organizations we serve throughout the entire Kansas City Metropolitan through our various lines of business. What's more, this commitment enables the Village to remain a leading provider of services and care to older adults, as well as a source of support for their families. In addition to providing quality care and services to seniors, the Village provides a diverse array of dependable, quality services, such as catering, banquet facilities, childcare and more, to members of the outside community - offerings that enable people of all ages to benefit from the Village's services. Because of the Village's size, diverse array of services, amenities and product offerings, we are able to allocate multiple resources toward our community involvement commitment. We share facilities, facilitate the giving of resident and associate time and talents, offer leadership and/or modest financial support to community-based organizations, share entertainment and promote education and intergenerational activities. In turn, the Village benefits greatly. - We are making strides in achieving the Village's mission, vision and values by enriching the lives of residents, associates and members of the surrounding community. - We are strengthening the Village's position as a valuable community resource and leader. - We are heightening awareness and understanding of John Knox Village. - We are enhancing the image of John Knox Village and breaking down stereotypes about aging and older adults. - We are generating interest in residency at or use of John Knox Village services. - We are promoting John Knox Village as a good place to live, work and conduct business with. - We are reinforcing the appropriateness of our not-for-profit status. The Village's community involvement initiative extends beyond volunteering and/or donating goods and services. We are taking steps to become a more sustainable, earth-friendly organization. What better way to make a positive impact on the communities we touch than by lessoning our carbon footprint for future generations? This report isn't just a showcase of the Village's generosity and our long-standing commitment to community involvement. It's really a story of our efforts to make a greater impact in the communities we are involved in. The Village's community involvement efforts enrich the lives of thousands of individuals - all of who are potential supporters, customers, residents or associates of our organization. We are proud of our accomplishments and excited about future community involvement prospects.

        <Explanation>Civic Engagement Civic engagement is an umbrella term used to describe how community service, political activity, service-learning, activism and advocacy can enhance the lives of individuals who give of their time as well as the communities in which we live and work. Chamber of Commerce/Economic Development John Knox Village's ongoing involvement in the Lee's Summit Chamber of Commerce has included leadership and financial support, as well as participation in the chamber's leadership development program. Management representatives have consistently served on various chamber committees and in officer positions. Currently, JKV President/CEO Dan Rexroth serves on the board of directors. The Village also offers financial and organizational support to chamber events, and, since its inception, more than 24 JKV associates have participated in Leadership Lee's Summit, a nine-month program designed to educate and build community leaders. Rexroth also serves as an advisor to the Lee's Summit Economic Development Council. Civic/Community Organizations Many John Knox Village community members are involved in a variety of worthwhile athletic, charitable, civic, church, and school organizations that are located throughout Lee's Summit and the rest of the Greater Kansas City Area. Although not sponsored or facilitated by John Knox Village, such involvement indirectly - yet positively - reflects on the Village. In addition, these organizations also benefit from the leadership, intellectual capital and other contributions by Village associates, residents and board members. The following list includes examples of the diversity of organizations in which JKV community members are involved. Activity Directors Association of Missouri, Boy Scouts of America, Center for Practical Bioethics, Citizen's Advisory Committee, Clean Air Lee's Summit, Funeral Consumer Alliance of Kansas City, Girl Scouts of the USA, Greater Kansas City Community Foundation Board, Heartland Men's Chorus, Humane Society, Indian Association of Kansas City, Jackson County CASA, Junior Achievement of Middle America Inc., Kannada Sangha of Kansas City, Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, Lee's Summit Optimists, Lee's Summit Chamber of Commerce, Lee's Summit Chamber of Commerce Healthcare Committee, Lee's Summit Economic Development Council, Lee's Summit Character Council, Lee's Summit Senior Citizen Board of Directors, Lee's Summit Senior Service Providers, Lee's Summit Sunrise Rotary Club, Lee's Summit R-7 School District, Mayor's Health and Education Advisory Board, Missouri Association for Directors of Volunteer Services, Missouri and Kansas Association of Health Plans, Musical Theater For Young People, National Association of Public Hospitals, Raymore Historical Society, Sunset Garden Club, United Way Review Board and Workforce Investment Board. Numerous John Knox Village associates and residents also have served in different capacities on various Chamber of Commerce committees. The John Knox Village community has a leader who strongly believes in giving back to the community. President/CEO Dan Rexroth is an active member of multiple professional and community-based organizations, including Treasurer, Board of Directors for the Institute to Transform Senior Life; member, Board of Directors of the Greater Lee's Summit Healthcare Foundation; member, Board of Directors of the Lee's Summit Chamber of Commerce; member, Board of Directors of the Palestine Economic Development Corporation; Chair, Board of Directors of Caring Communities Insurance Company; member, Lee's Summit Civic Roundtable; and member, Advisory Board for the Lee's Summit Economic Development Council. Political Participation John Knox Village residents actively participate in political activities, issues, campaigns and voting. They frequently invite and host elected officials and candidates to speak to resident groups and occasionally organize letter-writing campaigns on issues important to them. From time to time, the Village provides support to these efforts. The Village also leases space to the Jackson County Board of Election Commissioners for five Lee's Summit voting precincts. Residents readily volunteer to man those polling places as well as voting sites located outside the Village campus. During fiscal year 2010, several elected officials, such as State Rep. Will Kraus and Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, held town hall forums open to John Knox Village residents and members of the outside public. Public Safety Emergency Management John Knox Village's Public Safety Department (which includes Dispatch, Transportation, Security, EMS, and Emergency Management services) provides services to more than just Village residents and associates, but to members of the outside community as well. The Village's ability and willingness to provide assistance helps take financial and staffing strains off stressed city and state programs. On the flip side, during emergency situations that occur outside the Village campus, John Knox Village Public Safety can allocate resources and man-power to assist city and state response efforts.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>A series of partnerships with a variety of local, state, regional and national public service organizations has enabled the JKV Public Safety department to assist with security, emergency service administration and more. Public Safety's partnerships include: Lee's Summit Emergency Services (police, fire department), local hospitals, local care facilities, Jackson County Emergency Management, Jackson County Health Department, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, (Missouri) State Emergency Management Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Homeland Security - to name a few. Public Safety provides many services to Lee's Summit and surrounding communities. Examples include: - Security patrols at community events, such as Lee's Summit Downtown Days. - Non-emergency transport of patients between hospitals as well as local care facilities. - Mutual Aid Agreements: In addition to assisting the residents of John Knox Village, Public Safety has mutual aid agreements with the cities of Lee's Summit, Mo., and Raytown, Mo. With the agreement, when the need arises to respond to an emergency within city limits, John Knox Village Public Safety services can help out. What's more, the Village is a member of a Kansas City metropolitan-wide emergency preparedness group so if a city or region-wide emergency were to occur, the Village would be able to assist after first assisting its own community members - residents and associates. - Donation of location and coordination assistance for a Jackson County Health Department H1N1 Flu Clinic - Conducting emergency preparedness activities. Activities include developing plans and analysis; fostering relationships with city, state and national organizations, such as the fire department, the Jackson County Health Department and the American Red Cross; continuing education and training for associates; communication; and conducting exercises, such as fire drills, to test our response time and planning. Being prepared enables the Village to better respond to and assist with emergencies both on campus and within the community. Corporate and Community Philanthropy John Knox Village offers modest financial support to efforts and organizations throughout the Lee's Summit and Greater Kansas City communities that have measurable social impact within the community and/or support older adults. The Village has three categories of giving. Corporate giving helps build awareness of the Village and integrates the organization into the local community. Examples of corporate giving in fiscal year 2010 include financial support of the Lee's Summit Parks and Recreation baseball league; the Lee's Summit Chamber of Commerce golf tournament; Downtown Lee's Summit's Piccadilly Gala; Lee's Summit Chamber of Commerce Oktoberfest; Mayor's Community of Character Breakfast; Lee's Summit Educational Foundation events; and others. The Village also makes efforts to support state and national associations, for example, the Missouri Association of Homes for the Aging and the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. Community giving helps make Lee's Summit and surrounding communities stronger. Examples include donations to the Lee's Summit city-wide Martin Luther King Celebration, Lee's Summit CARES, Hope House, the Shepherd Center of Kansas City, Lee's Summit Social Services, and others. A resident-run group, "Seniors on Missions," conducted a service project to collect children's books for the Story Link Prison Ministry. The books were to be taken, along with a cassette tape, to prisoners who would read the book and record it on the tape. The book and tape will then be taken to the prisoner's child so they can hear their parent read to them. All together, they collected eight boxes full of books from residents, associates and community members. One Village associate and his daughter collected half of the books donated. Leah Nigh, 12-year-old daughter of Director of Materials Management Gary Nigh, held a birthday party and asked her friends to donate a book rather than bring a gift. In addition, Gary asked members of a soccer team he coaches to donate a book to the cause. Thanks to their efforts, Leah and Gary collected four boxes of books! Workplace giving enables generous people to give back. As a drop-off location for the U.S. Marines Toys For Tots program, both Village associates and residents are able to help children throughout the community have a merrier holiday season. What's more, John Knox Village is a long-time United Way supporter. In addition to raising funds that make a critical difference in the Greater Kansas City area, members of the JKV community have the opportunity to contribute to a JKV Special Project Campaign to raise funds for lasting and meaningful projects on the Village campus. In FY10, the United Way/JKV Special Project Campaign raised $13,869. Cultural Offerings/Special Events John Knox Village hosts and sponsors a number of special events each year that are open to members of the Village community and surrounding areas. These activities are a way to share resources and allow people to have a positive experience on the Village campus. Lee's Summit Concert Association The Lee's Summit Concert Association was established in 1992 under the leadership of John Knox Village resident Florence Hoogesteger. The association's goal is to offer high-quality concerts at a low cost that, in turn, add to the cultural offerings available to Village residents and members of surrounding communities. Village residents and associates, as well as members of the greater community, serve as association board members and officers and make vital contributions to membership recruitment efforts. The Village provides concert assistance and offers public relations support to the association. More than 1,000 attendees enjoyed performances by internationally-known entertainers and musicians at each of the association's four concerts. Music Group Performances In FY10, John Knox Village music groups performed throughout the metropolitan area multiple times for a variety of organizations. The performances enable residents to showcase their talents as well as aid charitable organizations that often have fewer resources than the Village. Organizations requesting performances included nursing homes, retiree groups, senior community centers, retirement communities, churches, parks and recreation organizations and schools. Special Events The Village sponsors a number of special events each year that are open to members of the Village community and surrounding areas. These activities are a way to share resources and allow people to have a positive experience at the Village. - Two annual JKV choral music concerts are held - one in May and one in December. - Free concerts included a performance by the American Legion Band. - The John Knox Village Community Theatre, which is a group of Village resident volunteers, puts on free productions three times a year. - The National Day of Prayer brought together clergy from various denominations for a day of united prayer for the country and our leaders. Members of the John Knox Village Chaplains Services department were key organizers for the event. Donation of John Knox Village Facilities and Equipment Classrooms/Meeting Spaces/Tours Because of the central location and availability of meeting room space, several organizations offer classes/seminars/meetings on the Village campus. Classroom/meeting space was donated to the Missouri League of Nursing; the Missouri Association of Homes for the Aging (MoAHA); Jackson County Food Handlers; the American Case Management Association-MOKAN Chapter; and "Wake Up to Success" and "Recess for Success" seminars, as well as the Governmental Relations Breakfast, all hosted by the Lee's Summit Chamber of Commerce.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Residents often are involved in civic/church/retiree groups not affiliated with the Village. These groups sometimes are invited to hold meetings on the Village campus. The Village also regularly hosts group tours of the campus for area schools, churches, Scout troops, business groups, etc. The aforementioned efforts help position John Knox Village as a good community resource and enable the organization to break down stereotypes about aging, retirement communities and John Knox Village in particular. During fiscal year 2010, the value of the donated classroom/meeting space was about $10,000. The Pavilion at John Knox Village John Knox Village donates The Pavilion at John Knox Village special event venue multiple times a year. Many of these events offer entertainment that might not otherwise be available if the appropriate space wasn't available. In other cases, important community meetings and programs are enhanced because of the amenities and services provided by The Pavilion's staff. In fiscal year 2010 The Pavilion was donated for a number of events, including the following, at a value of about $42,500. - Lee's Summit R-7 School District's annual Partners In Education Banquet - Lee's Summit Journal's annual Sports Banquet and Awards Ceremony - Lee's Summit R-7 New Teacher's Breakfast - Lee's Summit Journal's Senior Ball - Lee's Summit Mayor's Outreach Breakfast for Community of Character - Lee's Summit Chamber of Commerce annual banquet - Lee's Summit Martin Luther King Tribute - Lee's Summit high school orchestras' annual Pops Concert - Community Foundation of Lee's Summit - UMKC School of Nursing Seminar - Blood Center of KC Community Blood Drive - Downtown Lee's Summit Piccadilly Gala - Eastland Community Foundation Sing for Your Supper - Partners in Education Student Showcase - TAKE (The Ali Kemp Foundation) Self Defense Course - Jackson County Food Handlers Permit Class Surplus Equipment John Knox Village donates obsolete equipment or supplies to worthy causes. During fiscal year 2010, the Village donated maintenance/HVAC items to Habitat for Humanity and gently used cell phones to Hope House. Local schools and children's camps also have benefited from surplus supplies that can be used for classroom projects and/or activities. In addition, the Village has also donated items to nursing homes, churches and child care facilities. (It should be noted that donations to the Thrift Shop are the most-frequent outlets for these materials, allowing nominal funds to stay within the John Knox Village organization.) Education John Knox Village offers a variety of educational opportunities for people of all ages and skill levels that enhance the lives and careers of Village community members, as well as members of the outside community. Auxiliary Scholarship Program The John Knox Village Auxiliary Health Care Career Scholarship Committee received about 60 applications from students pursuing studies in a health care-related vocational/technical program at a college or university for its annual scholarship program. The committee awarded 20 $1,000 health care scholarships for a total of $20,000 in fiscal year 2010. The recipients were John Knox Village associates, family members of John Knox Village associates, family members of John Knox Village residents and members of the surrounding community. Early Childhood Development Since 1988 John Knox Village has had a child care center located on its campus. The Village initially provided space for the Lee's Summit Head Start program. Then, in February 1993, the Russell C. Flake Child Development Center, "The Children's Village," was established. The Children's Village is a full-day child development program for children between the ages of 6 weeks and 12 years. The Children's Village is licensed by the state of Missouri and has earned accreditation by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. Although the center's primary focus is to provide quality on-site childcare for John Knox Village associates, the program also is open to children who live in Lee's Summit and surrounding areas. A unique benefit of the center is the opportunity for the children to regularly interact and develop relationships with John Knox Village residents. This intergenerational engagement is beneficial for both the children and the residents. John Knox Village Emergency Training Institute The John Knox Village Emergency Training Institute is a training entity established within the John Knox Village Emergency Medical Services Department. It has been providing continuing education units of credit (CEUs) for paramedics and emergency medical technicians since it was established and accredited in June 2006. The institute provides initial emergency medical technician training, and our training facility accredits continuing education units of education provided by physicians and other EMS specialists at the Missouri State EMS Region A Committee meetings. The institute has provided several favorable outcomes for both the Village, and the community. In addition to training much needed emergency medical providers for the community, the Village was able to hire four individuals who successfully completed the classes. Mentoring Program In 2001, John Knox Village began a mentoring program in conjunction with the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine to provide an experiential setting for first- and second-year medical students to interact with "well elderly" JKV residents. Through conversations and social events, future doctors more fully understand the normal processes of aging and are able to eliminate negative stereotypes. The mentoring program also teaches the students how to relate to people as a whole person, not just a patient. By emphasizing communication and listening skills, the program helps shape an entire generation of physicians by making doctors more sensitive to issues affecting older adults and helping the doctors to become better listeners and more effective communicators. The John A. Hartford Foundation originally funded the project. In 2003, the mentoring program won the Distinguished Service Award through the Missouri Association of Homes for the Aging (MoAHA). The program received national attention in 2004 by being chosen for the Community Service Award through the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AASHA). In May 2006 the first students to participate in the mentoring program graduated. Partners in Education John Knox Village has been involved with the Lee's Summit School District's Partners in Education (PIE) program for 20 years. In addition to the educational opportunities for both the students and residents, PIE activities have provided positive media coverage. Village associates are actively involved in the program administration, and The Pavilion is donated to the school district every year for the annual Partners in Education Banquet, which recognizes and thanks all business partners in the R-7 School District. It is also important to note that residents actively support the Lee's Summit schools by voting in favor of bond and levy issues. Pilot LILA Program During FY10, John Knox Village participated in the federal pilot educational savings program, Lifelong Learning Accounts (LILA). LILAs are savings accounts that enable associates to make regular contributions that are matched by the Village up to a predetermined cap. Because the program pays education expenses upfront, such as books, tuition, supplies etc., adults are able to further their education without incurring debt. LILA is part of a national effort to promote lifelong learning and to raise the skill and education levels of the current workforce. The program was created from an initiative by the U.S. Department of Labor, Missouri Workforce Division and Kansas Department of Commerce. Schools of Nursing The Village Care Center at John Knox Village is involved in a beneficial clinical education partnership with the Metropolitan Community Colleges (which includes Penn Valley Community College, Brown Mackey College and Concord College) and the Colorado Technical University. More than 100 students have benefited from the hands-on, real-world experiences provided through the partnership. Students from Graceland School of Nursing work with independent living residents who volunteer to assist in the training of the future nurses. The nurses conduct health assessments, and teach clients about medications, health issues, wellness and lifestyle choices. Students visit volunteers three times in their homes. Finally, 26 nursing students from Concorde Career College visited The Children's Village for a series of observations as part of the college's pediatric rotation.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Summer Jobs for Youth In fiscal year 2010, John Knox Village supported the Next Generation Jobs Team, a Full Employment Council youth training program, by providing job experience to nine first-time workers. The program, funded by stimulus dollars, provides students ages 16-24 an eight-week internship at businesses in growth industries, such as non-profit organizations and healthcare entities. The training program enabled the Village to teach leadership, customer service and other important skills. Teaching A number of John Knox Village management team members participate in periodic or ongoing teaching positions and/or serve on advisory committees at area colleges and universities including the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Business, Central Missouri State University, Rockhurst University, Longview Community College and the University of Kansas. Environment/Sustainability Efforts John Knox Village is making strides to become a more sustainable, earth-friendly organization because being conscious of how our activities impact the environment is important to our associates and the residents. We are working to become better environmental stewards and to reduce our environmental impact through operational initiatives, energy conservation, recycling and waste management and more. - Residents and associates, alike, make use of "co-mingle" bins in which they can place paper, plastic, tin and aluminum. The original paper-only recycling program generated about $1,400 per year, and in 2009 the revenue was up to nearly $3,200. More recycling also reduces the amount of trash that needs to be removed, lowering trash dumping fees. The recycling funds are used to help offset the remaining dumping fees. - By replacing a 15- to 20-year-old cooling system in the Administrative Center, the Village anticipates reducing energy use by $13,000 per year. - A new cooling tower at the Village Care Center will reduce the electricity needed to cool the Care Center and will also save about $4,000 per year in electrical costs. - The Village had KCP&amp;L install Energy Optimizer thermostats in more than 400 Independent Living homes. The thermostats reduce energy use in each home by adjusting temperatures during heat waves for times when people are likely to be sleeping or not home. - The Village has replanted many of its public spaces to include plants that are native to the area and thus require less water throughout the summer. The landscaping department, too, has selected fertilizers and herbicides that are easier on the environment. - The Village has an ongoing commitment to preserving and enhancing green space and retaining as many mature trees as possible throughout its 400+ acre campus. In one of the Village's largest green spaces, the installation of natural stone blocks along the creek in Westminster Meadows has significantly reduced erosion and enhanced the beauty of the park. John Knox Village's other "green" efforts include: - Increased promotion of the John Knox Village Auxiliary Thrift Shop as a way for the Lee's Summit Community to recycle, reuse and repurpose items they no longer need. The thrift shop has been in the recycling business for 25 years. - Installation of more than 350 energy-efficient streetlights throughout the Village. - Replacement of pool pumps for the Village's indoor and outdoor pools that have reduced energy use by more than $3,500 per year. - Installation of motion sensors and energy-efficient light bulbs in common areas. - Introduction of saltwater sanitation systems which require far fewer chemicals to maintain the water quality of the pools. - Reduction of miles driven by the transportation vehicle fleet and business vehicles, reducing the use of gas, and reducing emissions. Industry/Professional Involvement Membership and involvement in industry and professional organizations aid in building the knowledge and skills of John Knox Village associates, introduce new ideas to the organization and enable Village associates to share expertise. Industry Involvement John Knox Village is actively involved in the Missouri Association of Homes for the Aging (MoAHA) and the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA). Membership in both organizations enables Village leadership to remain informed of industry trends and innovations. Members of the management staff attend the state and national conferences, make presentations at these conferences, serve on state and national committees and hold positions of leadership. Several other Village managers are members or serve on the boards of a variety of industry associations, such as the Kansas City Regional Home Care Association, Leavenworth County Senior Services, Lee's Summit Senior Center, Missouri Hospice and Palliative Care Association, National Hospice and Palliative Care Association, Missouri Alliance for Home Care, Professionals in Aging, Metropolitan Discharge Coordinators, Assisted Living Association of Kansas, the National Association of Home Care, Missouri Association of Nursing Home Administrators, Missouri League for Nursing, Institute to Transform Senior Life, and Full Employment Council/ Eastern Jackson County Workforce Investment, among others. The Village's general and professional liability insurance company, Caring Communities Insurance Company (CCIC), shoulders the advanced risk management and quality healthcare responsibilities for many other not-for-profit continuing care retirement communities around the nation. John Knox Village was a pioneer in the establishment of this innovative risk-financing program. The Village has experienced significant savings because of the group, which enables it to better meet community involvement goals and commitments. Professional Involvement Most members of the JKV management team are involved in the local chapters of professional associations, and a number hold leadership roles at the local, state and national level. From time to time, association meetings are held on the Village campus or feature a John Knox Village associate as a speaker. Examples of professional associations include the American Health Information Management Association, American Society of Safety Engineers, Association of Medical Staff Services, American Association of Nurse Assessment Coordinators, American Congress of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, Board of Certified Safety Professionals, Association of Energy Engineers, Dietary Managers Association, Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), International Association of Business Communicators (IABC), Human Resources Management Association (HRMA) of Greater Kansas City, Healthcare Compliance Association, Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA), American Society of Healthcare Risk Managers, Kansas City Regional Healthcare Materials Management Association, Activity Director Association of Missouri, American Society of Heating and Refrigeration, Missouri Association of Directors of Volunteer Service in Healthcare (KCADVS), National Association for the Education of Young Children, Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc., Association of Fundraising Professionals, Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), Group Leaders of America (GLAMER), Missouri Restaurant Association (MRA), Health Care Food Service Management (HFM), Kansas City Compensation and Benefits Association, the Kansas City Chapter of International Society of Certified Employee Benefits Specialists, The Family Conservancy Accreditation Project, Missouri Area Hospitals and Auxiliaries, Culinary Advisors Board for the Olathe School District, the Kansas State Advisory Board for Hospitality Management, and literally dozens of others. Support Groups John Knox Village offers a variety of support groups for residents, their families and the community. During fiscal year 2010, the Village offered an Alzheimer's and Dementia Support Group, Low Vision Support Group, Parkinson's Support Group, Dealing with Loss Support Group, Caregivers Support Group and Cancer Support Group. The organization also offers spiritual support groups for reading, prayer and discussion that are open to the public, some of which are led by community volunteers. The groups are available to residents of independent living, residential care and the Village Care Center.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>John Knox Village Auxiliary Since 1989, the John Knox Village Auxiliary has donated funds to Lee's Summit Social Services to purchase medical supplies for an area child through a program called "Our Child." Last year about $1,800 was contributed, with $610 of that amount being collected from simple cans placed on the counters of the various Auxiliary shops, beauty salons, and the Village's on-campus ice cream parlor. Additionally Thrift Shop volunteers hosted hot dog sales during the summer, raising $800 after only six sales. In addition to the community service project, the five shops operated by the Auxiliary - the Thrift Shop, Village Care Center gift shop and three gift/grocery stores - serve residents, associates and non-residents. Nearly 75 percent of the 150 average daily customers at the Thrift Shop live outside the Village. Some of the items donated to the Thrift Shop are passed on to the Shepherd Center of Kansas City, Truman Medical Center Lakewood Care Center residents and Hope House. See the "Education" section for information on the Auxiliary's Health Career Scholarships. John Knox Village Board of Directors Because good governance is vital in business, one of the most valuable assets the business community can offer is intellectual capital. Members of the John Knox Village Board of Directors are volunteers who offer insight and help make decisions about strategy, direction and mission. The board is made up of three resident and six non-resident members. Most board members are involved in a number of professional and civic organizations and are or were prominent in their professions. The board members' involvement reflects well on John Knox Village, and their connections help spread the word about the Village. John Knox Village Foundation The John Knox Village Foundation was established in August 1983 to allow residents and friends of the Village to make tax-deductible contributions to projects they feel are beneficial to the elderly both at the Village and throughout society. For the past several years, the Foundation has been focusing a great deal of its efforts and resources on trying to determine how technology can benefit the lives of seniors who live on the John Knox Village campus and throughout the Kansas City and surrounding areas. This is particularly important since within 20 years the number of individuals 65 or over will double to more than 77 million. In fact, the senior population in our area alone will double in the next 10 years. With the current system for assisting the aging population already stressed to the breaking point, new approaches are an absolute necessity. The Foundation is working on many fronts to help find those new approaches. Because most seniors prefer to stay at home rather than move to a retirement community or long-term care facility, the Foundation has been exploring ways to turn this wish into reality. - The Foundation has developed key business relationships with companies throughout Europe and the United Kingdom, which rely on home-health based care models rather than the facility-based approach found in the United States. The Foundation has found numerous tele-health applications and different types of equipment that will allow for the monitoring of a senior's well-being in their home. - The Foundation is now testing affordable new home health monitoring equipment systems that can be used in clients' homes instead of the client having to go to doctor offices or clinics. - Working with a US-based company called Touchtown, the Foundation has found a way for seniors to communicate with one another, arrange for services and communicate with family via the Internet. This will reduce the isolation that many seniors who live alone experience in their later years. A partnership between the technology applications and the clinical services offered by Village Home Health has led to the founding of Home For Life Solutions. Home For Life Solutions provides the wide range of services and technology products that seniors and individuals with limiting illnesses or abilities require in order for them to remain in their homes. The funding to create this new system and make it operational came from gifts to the John Knox Village Foundation. In addition to these direct approaches, the foundation is working with several local foundations and a national organization called Grant Makers in Aging to increase private and public funding for the types of services noted above. In another major comprehensive initiative call "KC 4 Aging," a large work group, including the Foundation staff, which is determining what types of services will be needed to assist the seniors of the future in our area. These will include transportation, medical services, infrastructure changes, care options, daily living support and social activities. The group is assessing what exists now and what must be put in place to meet increasing demand. Failure to plan now means the senior of the future will suffer needlessly. Volunteer Opportunities Members of the John Knox Village community are always ready to roll up their sleeves and lend a helping hand. Volunteer opportunities have included organizational leaders helping out on Campus Beautification Day to serving dinner at a volunteer appreciation function. In addition, many associates and residents volunteer their time and talents outside the Village campus. Their willingness to help inspires a broader mission, and the Village supports their efforts wherever possible.</Explanation>

Student Volunteer Program Each year students from the Lee's Summit high schools, O'Hara High School, St. Teresa's High School, Blue Springs High School, Rockhurst High School and other area schools complete required community service hours at John Knox Village. The students are assigned to various activities and special events throughout campus. The students are purposely placed in volunteer opportunities that have direct contact with residents and go along with the Village mission of supporting intergenerational activities within and outside of John Knox Village. During the summer months, the Village Care Center at John Knox Village administers a Junior Volunteer Program for students 13 and older. Village Hospice Volunteers Village Hospice of John Knox Village also has a group of dedicate volunteers who donate their time and talents in a variety of ways. Hospice volunteers play an important role in assuring quality of life for hospice patients. Along with a warm and caring attitude, each volunteer brings a unique set of life experiences and skills to use in working with patients and families. The volunteers provide a variety of services, from offering simple companionship, such as listening, playing games or just sitting quietly, to arranging flowers or helping with office work. During fiscal year 2010, Hospice volunteers, including both members of the Village community and the outside community, contributed 600 hours of care and service to the Hospice program. Conclusion Enriching lives and building community - both within and outside the John Knox Village community - is intrinsic to the success of John Knox Village. Community involvement activities offer rewarding experiences for Village residents and associates, touch the lives of people of all ages, enhance the Village's image, further organizational business goals, and promote the Village as a great place to live and work. Moreover, a strong community is essential to a strong John Knox Village and helps define the Village as a leading provider of services. Want to learn more about the programs listed in this report?
