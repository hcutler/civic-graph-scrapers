        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>GSVA JOURNEY PROGRAM: Designed to develop students' right-brain capacities, the Journey Program maximizes the benefits of visual learning through a comprehensive and cumulative curriculum. The curriculum is organized into 10-week series with each series incorporating various art elements, principles, media and techniques in relation to a specific theme. An innovative core component to all Journey series is the curatorial education where each young artist collaborates with other artists in designing, installing and curating an exhibition of their own work. The Journey curriculum is designed to integrate with public school instruction and help students meet State Content Standard benchmarks in all subject areas. GSVA's PRE-SCHOOL/KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM lays the foundation for a lifetime of creative thinking. The program is a child-centered, exploration-based approach to early childhood education, organized around a specific theme, with a focus on art as the vehicle for active learning. Our approach shares important principles with the Reggio Emilia pedagogy. JOURNEY 1, THE ART OF THE SELF-PORTRAIT, is the first in a two-part foundational series designed to prepare each student for advanced artistic explorations. Instruction is centered on the theme of the self-portrait, which allows students to examine many different and unique dimensions of themselves. During JOURNEY 2, DREAMWORLDS, the second part of our foundational series, GSVA students move beyond explorations of the physical self and begin to focus on the many rich dimensions of their imaginations. They are encouraged to draw upon their dreams and their daydreams as subject matter in their artworks. After completing both Journey 1 and Journey 2, each student is prepared to embark on a unique and personalized creative course of study in the Journey 360 program. JOURNEY 360 is an authentic student-centered learning that celebrates each child's unique ideas and creative development. 240 students were served and 2,400 visitors enjoyed the student exhibitions at GSVA along with 2,740 visitors at traveling exhibitions.</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>IN-SCHOOL PROGRAMS: GSVA provides an entirely new form of support to public school districts and other education organizations. GSVA is deeply committed to engaging students, building their interest in learning, fostering their creative courage and teaching for meaningful learning and deep understandings. We aim to captivate students, parents, teachers and administrators alike with innovative approaches to fusing arts-based learning with other subjects. Our team works with school leadership, school reformers and teachers of all grades and subject areas in developing curricula based on an intriguing premise: that creativity and art can bolster kids' abilities to learn in other subject areas such as science and math. COLLABORATIONS: GSVA contributes to innovative education reform efforts on a local, state and national level, helping teachers and administrators embed a culture of creativity into every aspect of student learning. Our collaborators include:* KnowledgeWorks Foundation, funded by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation * U.S. Department of Education, Project ASPIRE * The Ohio State University, Project ASPIRE * Columbus City Schools, Project ASPIRE * Ohio Department of Education * Denison University * Liberty Local Schools, Youngstown Ohio * Reynoldsburg City Schools * Granville Exempted Village Schools * Newark City Schools * Cincinnati Fine Arts Fund. CONSULTING: GSVA provides consulting in the following areas. * Curriculum design * Teaching for creativity and innovation in all domains * Arts integration * Assessment * Credit flexibility for high school students * School improvement and transformation * Innovative new school design * Teacher professional development * Quality after-school educational programming. GSVA is also the first Ohio community-based organization to create public school study groups for teachers in all subject areas wishing to practice arts integration in their classrooms. This work is an extension of Pistone's "Learning Communities for Innovative Practice" initiative that was originally created for art teachers. TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: GSVA offers professional development for teachers, administrators and other educational and arts organizations. In addition to working with individuals, we are available for professional speaking engagements. We address arts education, arts integration, teaching for creativity and best practices for 21st-century education. A conservative estimate of the number of individuals served through our In-School programs is 4,500.</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>R&amp;D LAB: Where Great Design Joins Great Thinking in all Disciplines. This program is new to GSVA, beginning in the spring of 2010. Our educational goal in the R&amp;D Lab is to cultivate a new generation of confident innovators, inventors and leaders in every field who see and understand the world through the lens of a designer. The R&amp;D Lab is an after-school learning center in which students enhance their core studies with creativity and design skills. Kids participating in The R&amp;D Lab learn how to bring design thinking into all subject areas, especially STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). GSVA draws on our close collaborations with school teachers and advisors in these subjects to help R&amp;D Lab students bolster their in-school learning in unique, exciting and aesthetically sophisticated ways. The R&amp;D Lab provides an environment rarely found in most schools but demanded by industry leaders. As a first step, teens are challenged to design projects based on problems or questions they identify themselves. Then, through the course of the project, students learn how to share their information, develop a point-of -view and express their knowledge of the topic at hand, whether it be science, technology, engineering or math through the lens of a documentary photographer or film maker. All R&amp;D Lab programs align with high school content standards with full representation of two or more disciplines. In fact, GSVA students taking R&amp;D Lab classes may qualify for interdisciplinary high school credit under SB311, Ohio's Credit Flexibility Law. The R&amp;D Lab served 25 students in the initial documentary film program. The student documentary film, Cedar Rapids, has the potential to be seen by thousands of individuals in the next fiscal year.</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>
