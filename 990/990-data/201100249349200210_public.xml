        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>Parent Leadership Initiative: This program trains parents to support their children's educational achievements, and teaches mothers and fathers the skills needed to be leaders and advocates. In past years, the PESA program has reached more than 1000 parents. It is a 6 session behavior change program that presents innovative ideas and techniques to help parents guide their children through school. Last year, PESA was presented to 10 different schools in Arlington and in Washington, DC. Led by specially trained parents who are leaders in their school PTAs and school committees, PESA focuses on different parenting skills, where parents have the opportunity to share concerns and build a network for mutual support. The program has been acclaimed by parents with 99% of parents who have taken the course rating it as an excellent program. In addition, during the year we developed PARTICIPA, a program that teachers parents to advocate for their own children and all children in school. (287 parents benefitted from our Parent Leadership Initiatives this year)</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>Youth Development Programs: The Emerging Leaders Program (ELP) ensures that more Latinos graduate from high school, apply for college, receive scholarships, and increase their leadership and communication skills to enable them to prosper in college as leaders. ELP is held three times per year during the spring, summer, and fall, and involves students from the Greater DC region, including Arlington and Washington, DC. Many of the students who participate are from families of modest means and are potential first generation college students. Students are paired with young professionals who volunteer to be mentors. They provide one-on-one support and guide students through the college and scholarship application process, and provide valuable advice on life and academics. In addition to building their skills on time management, team building, public speaking, and essay writing, students participate in field trips to local universities and learn the importance of volunteering through community service projects. Students also practice applying for scholarships and participate in a small scholarship competition offered by the program. (56 Latino high school students completed ELP during the year)</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>Spanish/Academic Classes: In our flagship Saturday program, we offer Spanish to pre-kindergarten through 8th grade students, and English and Spanish classes to parents and other adults. Last year, we also expanded by launching an early childhood course in partnership with Arlington County's Project Family for infants and toddlers ages 0-3. Project Family instructs children and their parents together in Spanish as they learn activities that broaden motor skills and language development through music and play. Spanish classes for children and adults are taught by native Spanish speakers. The curriculum for children is aligned to the Virginia Department of Education's science standards. Children are divided by grade and learn about science, math, art, and music as they practice reading, writing, and speaking in Spanish. Adult classes include a beginners and intermediate course. After one year in the program, our evaluation indicates improvement in reading, writing, and oral skills. Students also participate in a computer lab where they have the opportunity to further build their skills. (203 children and adults participated in our Spanish classes.)</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>College Scholarship Fund: Through our scholarship program, we offer scholarships that range from $100 to $1500, with preference given to students who have been enrolled in our programs. Participation in the application process gives students training for applying for bigger scholarships from other sources. Recipients are selected by a committee who bases selection on academic potential, financial need and service to the community. This year, nearly $ 3000 (mostly in small amounts) was awarded primarily to students who participated in the college scholarship application training exercise in the Emerging Leaders Program. After high school graduation, the awards are paid directly to the college/university of the awardees' choice. (50 students applied; 13 were awarded small grants.)</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>English Language Program: Our ESL classes are for immigrant parents and adults who wish to increase their English proficiency, gain computer literacy skills, and learn about American culture. This program is based on the REEP curriculum of Arlington County and also offers interested participants special sessions on parent leadership and on pursuing a higher education. The program evaluates student gains on the Best Plus test, with 20% of students showing a gain of one or more levels after 60 hours of instruction. Classes met two nights a week, and in addition, students practiced ESL for 3 more hours on the computer. Our students reported that because we offered ESL classes in their own neighborhoods at times they wanted, we made it possible for them to study, despite heavy work and home obligations. (73 adult students enrolled in ESL classes.)</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>Arlington Latino Network (ALN): The Arlington Latino Network was created in 2009 by a group of Arlington parents, students, alumni and leaders of community organizations committed to advocate for the educational achievement of Latino students; promote a more balanced understanding of the experiences of Latino students and their families; and advance collaborative efforts to take actions for improving educational outcomes for Latino children and youth in Arlington to ensure their success in school and in life. Escuela Bolivia was a key partner in the founding of the organization as many of the parents involved in ALN have emerged from our parent leadership programs. In addition to participating in ALN's events, we support ALN's outreach efforts and provide accounting and financial management assistance.</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>
