(THE ORGANIZATION OR UNITED WAY) COLLABORATES WITH VOLUNTEERS, STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS TO UNCOVER KEY STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY-BASED SOLUTIONS TO OUR COMMUNITY'S MOST PRESSING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE ISSUES. BEYOND QUICK FIXES, THESE STRATEGIES ARE DELIVERING LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS, ALIGNED WITH BENCHMARKS AND ACHIEVEMENT STANDARDS, TO CHANGE COMMUNITY CONDITIONS. UNITED WAY OF SOUTHERN NEVADA IS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION GOVERNED BY A LOCAL, VOLUNTEER BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE ORGANIZATION WAS INCORPORATED IN 1957 AND ITS OPERATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN CLARK COUNTY. THE ORGANIZATION IS ONE OF NEARLY 1,300 LOCAL, INDEPENDENT UNITED WAYS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. UNITED WAY'S VISION IS THAT SOUTHERN NEVADA IS A GREAT COMMUNITY WHERE ALL PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE AN EXTRAORDINARY QUALITY OF LIFE. OUR MISSION IS TO UNITE LEADERSHIP, ENGAGE COMMUNITY AND FOCUS RESOURCES TO MAKE LASTING CHANGES TO IMPROVE LIVES IN OUR COMMUNITY. UNITED WAY WORKS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY AGENCIES, BUSINESSES, LABOR, GOVERNMENTS, AND OTHER FUNDING SOURCES TO ACHIEVE ITS MISSION. THE ORGANIZATION ADDRESSES THE ROOT CAUSES TO OUR COMMUNITY'S MOST PRESSING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ISSUES THROUGH COLLABORATION AND INNOVATION, AND A RESULTS-FOCUSED THEORY OF CHANGE MODEL. THIS UNIQUE METHODOLOGY, ALIGNED WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S MISSION AND VISION, IS REFERRED TO AS THE "COMMUNITY-BASED AGENDA" AND IS DESIGNED TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON CHRONIC HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE NEEDS BEING CONFRONTED BY SOUTHERN NEVADANS. UNITED WAY ENGAGES THE COMMUNITY IN IDENTIFYING THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LOCAL ISSUES, DEVELOPING STRATEGIES AND MOBILIZING THE REQUIRED FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THEM, AND MEASURE THE RESULTS. THE ORGANIZATION TACKLES ISSUES BASED ON CURRENT, LOCAL NEEDS. UNITED WAY'S FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, FINANCIAL STABILITY AND SAFETY NET SERVICES. ANNUAL FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGNS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGHOUT THE FISCAL YEAR'S ANNUAL CAMPAIGN TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS PRIMARILY IN THE SUBSEQUENT FISCAL YEAR. CAMPAIGN DOLLARS SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY-BASED INITIATIVES, A VARIETY OF LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS, AND THE ORGANIZATION'S OPERATING EXPENSES. UNITED WAY'S WORKPLACE GIVING CAMPAIGNS INCLUDE OVER 300 COMPANIES, SOLICITING OVER 200,000 EMPLOYEES WITH 50,000 DONORS. THE 2009-2010 GROSS COMMUNITY CAMPAIGN RAISED 12,165,707 REPRESENTING A 3% INCREASE FROM THE 2008-2009 CAMPAIGN. AFFINITY GROUPS INCLUDE THE TOCQUEVILLE SOCIETY, WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AND YOUNG PHILANTHROPISTS SOCIETY. UNITED WAY'S TOCQUEVILLE SOCIETY HONORS INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES WHO INVEST 10,000 OR MORE ANNUALLY TO THE CAMPAIGN. LOCALLY, THE ORGANIZATION BOASTS 57 TOCQUEVILLE SOCIETY MEMBERS WITH A COMBINED CONTRIBUTION THAT HAS EXCEEDED 1.1 MILLION FOR THE 2009-2010 CAMPAIGN. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 2009-2010 CAMPAIGN, THE NUMBER OF WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP COUNCIL MEMBERS TOTALED 119, REPRESENTING A 21% MEMBERSHIP INCREASE FROM THE 2008-2009 CAMPAIGN AND A 24% INCREASE IN DOLLARS RAISED.

RESTRICTED DESIGNATIONS ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO ANY 501(C)3 APPROVED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. DURING THE 2009-2010 CAMPAIGN, UNITED WAY PROCESSED 3,976,980 IN DONOR-DESIGNATED RESTRICTED FUNDS. DONOR-DESIGNATED FUNDS ARE CONTRIBUTIONS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED BY THE DONOR TO BE FORWARDED TO OTHER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORGANIZATION ACTS SIMPLY AS AN AGENT THAT COLLECTS, PROCESSES AND DISBURSES FUNDS. THE ORGANIZATION PROVIDES THIS SERVICE AS A CONVENIENCE TO OUR DONORS, AND BEING SEPARATE AND APART FROM OUR MISSION-ORIENTED FUNCTIONS, WE DO NOT REQUIRE THE RECIPIENT ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE USE AND RESULTS OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS. SINCE OUR LOCAL BEGINNING MORE THAN 50 YEARS AGO, THE ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS OF UNITED WAY OF SOUTHERN NEVADA HAVE BEEN BASED UPON THE MODELS OF TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY. EACH YEAR, A LOCAL FINANCE COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF CPAS, ACCOUNTANTS AND CORPORATE LEADERS REVIEWS THE ANNUAL BUDGET AND INTERNAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES. IN ADDITION, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AN INDEPENDENT, CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM CONDUCTS AN AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED AUDITING STANDARDS.
