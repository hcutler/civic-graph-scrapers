        <ReturnReference>SCHEDULE D, PART X</ReturnReference>
        <Explanation>THE ORGANIZATION IS AN AFFILIATE WITHIN THE CROZER-KEYSTONE HEALTH SYSTEM AND CONTROLLED AFFILIATES ("SYSTEM"); A TAX-EXEMPT INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. CROZER-KEYSTONE HEALTH SYSTEM ("CKHS") IS THE TAX-EXEMPT PARENT OF THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM ISSUES CONSOLIDATED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH INCLUDE ALL RELATED ENTITIES; INCLUDING THIS ORGANIZATION. THE CONSOLIDATED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ALSO CONTAIN CONSOLIDATING SCHEDULES ON AN ENTITY BY ENTITY BASIS. THE FIN 48 FOOTNOTE BELOW IS FROM THE SYSTEM'S FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2008 CONSOLIDATED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN 2006, FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48), ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WAS ISSUED. FIN 48 CREATES A SINGLE MODEL TO ADDRESS UNCERTAINTY IN TAX POSITION AND CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING THE MINIMUM RECOGNITION THRESHOLD A TAX POSITION IS REQUIRED TO MEET BEFORE BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF FIN 48, A TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATION MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD AN OBLIGATION AS THE RESULT OF A TAX POSITION HISTORICALLY TAKEN ON VARIOUS TAX EXPOSURES ITEMS. PRIOR TO FIN 48, THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN TO RECORD A LIABILITY FOR A TAX EXPOSURE WAS BASED ON WHETHER A LIABILITY WAS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES. ON JULY 1, 2007, CKHS ADOPTED FIN 48. THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48 ON CKHS'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.</Explanation>

        <BadDebtFootnote>BAD DEBT EXPENSE WAS CALCULATED USING THE PROVIDERS' BAD DEBT EXPENSE FROM FINANCIAL STATEMENT, NET OF ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF AT CHARGES. THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS AFFILIATES PREPARE AND ISSUE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE SYSTEM'S ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (BAD DEBT EXPENSE) METHODOLOGY AND CHARITY CARE POLICIES ARE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACROSS ALL HOSPITAL AFFILIATES. THE ATTACHED TEXT WAS OBTAINED FROM THE FOOTNOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION. RECEIVABLES FOR PATIENT CARE PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FOR WHICH CKHS RECEIVES PAYMENT UNDER COST REIMBURSEMENT, PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT FORMULAE, OR NEGOTIATED RATES, WHICH COVER THE MAJORITY OF PATIENT SERVICES, ARE STATED AS THE ESTIMATED NET AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM PAYORS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN THE ESTABLISHED BILLING RATES OF CKHS. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE REPORTED NET OF PROVISIONS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED COLLECTIONS, BUSINESS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, AND OTHER COLLECTION INDICATORS. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS CKHS PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY OF PATIENTS TO MAKE PAYMENTS FOR SERVICES. THE ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED BY ANALYZING SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS AND HISTORICAL DATA AND TRENDS. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WHEN MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT RECOVERY IS UNLIKELY AND CKHS CEASES COLLECTION EFFORTS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009, THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS INCLUDES UNFAVORABLE COLLECTION EXPERIENCE ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM PRIOR YEARS OF APPROXIMATELY $0 AND $4,600, RESPECTIVELY. CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY SERVICE CKHS PROVIDES CARE TO PATIENTS WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA UNDER ITS CHARITY CARE POLICY WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT AMOUNTS LESS THAN THE ESTABLISHED RATES. BECAUSE CKHS DOES NOT PURSUE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DETERMINED TO QUALIFY AS CHARITY CARE, THEY ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, CKHS SPONSORS CERTAIN OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY. SUCH PROGRAMS INCLUDE SERVICES TO NEEDY POPULATIONS INCLUDING COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY. CKHS ALSO ACTIVELY SPONSORS PROGRAMS ON HEALTH EDUCATION AND WELLNESS.</BadDebtFootnote>
        <ShortfallAsCommunityBenefit>MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2010 TEN MONTH INTERIM COST REPORT. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE ("IRC") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM "CHARITABLE" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT "[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE," AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM "CHARITABLE" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE "CHARITY CARE STANDARD." UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH "REMOVE[D]" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 "THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST." UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE "COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD," HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE "GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE" OF THE TERM "CHARITABLE," AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS "PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEUDLE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ("AHA") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION ("MEDPAC") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED "DUAL ELIGIBLES." THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ("CBO") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT "THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE." - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS "SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NAT</ShortfallAsCommunityBenefit>
        <DebtCollectionPolicy>ACCOUNTS CONSIDERED TO BE CHARITY CARE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, BUT RATHER, ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ALLOWANCE. IT IS THE POLICY OF THE CROZER-KEYSTONE HEALTH SYSTEM BUSINESS OFFICE, AND ALL ITS HOSPITAL AFFILIATES, TO TREAT ALL PATIENTS EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. FOR ACCOUNTS DETERMINED TO BE 'SELF-PAY" AND/OR ACCOUNTS WITH BALANCE AFTER PRIMARY INSURANCE PAYMENTS, THE COLLECTION POLICY REQUIRES: SENDING FOUR STATEMENTS, A MINIMUM OF ONE PRE-COLLECTION LETTER, TELEPHONE CONTACT FOR ANY ACCOUNT OVER $10 OR AT THE DISCRETION OF THE ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVE AND/OR SUPERVISOR. THE FACILITY ALSO HAS A CHARITY CARE ACCESS POLICY TO ASSURE PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DETERMINED BY STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS. IT IS THE POLICY TO INFORM ALL PATIENTS DEEMED SELF-PAY OF THE APPROPRIATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE. PATIENTS APPLYING FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE WILL BE FINANCIALLY SCREENED BY A RESOURCE ADVISOR TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY ACCORDING TO STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND WILL BE INFORMED OF DOCUMENTATION NEEDED TO COMPLETE A CHARITY CARE APPLICATION. PATIENTS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE WILL BE FINANCIALLY COUNSELED FOR ALL OTHER OPTIONS. QUALIFIED PATIENTS WILL BE REFERRED TO ALL APPROPRIATE AGENCIES OR PROGRAMS TO MEET OTHER FINANCIAL NEEDS. AT THE TIME OF THE PATIENT VISIT AND PART OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AT THE FACILITY, THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS: - FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR POSSIBLE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDING MEDICAID AND SSI; - FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR POSSIBLE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CROZER-KEYSTONE HEALTH SYSTEM PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; AND, - FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING: 1. CASH/CREDIT CARD (AMERICAN EXPRESS, DISCOVER, VISA, MASTERCARD), OR 2. FLEXIBLE PAYMENT PLANS. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE OPTIONS, THE FACILITY HAS ESTABLISHED A SELF-PAY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR OUR UNINSURED PATIENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID OR THE PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL CARE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE SELF-PAY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM RATES ARE REFLECTIVE OF MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT, AS REFERRED BY THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.</DebtCollectionPolicy>

        <NeedsAssessment>CROZER-KEYSTONE HEALTH SYSTEM RESPONDS TO THE COMMUNITY'S IDENTIFIED NEEDS BY SEEKING OUT PARTNERSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WILL TARGET THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS. SELECTION OF STAFF TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE INDIVIDUAL AND CULTURAL COMPOSITION OF THE COMMUNITIES TO BE SERVED. WE HAVE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIY MORE CLOSELY AND ARE MORE INCLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS WHERE THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OF SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. ONCE STAFF IS SELECTED, TRAINING AND SUPERVISION OCCUR ON AN ON-GOING BASIS TO ASSURE THAT TARGETED GOALS ARE BEING MET AND THAT THE COMMUNITY IS POSITIVELY RESPONDING TO PROGRAMS. COMMUNITY PROGRAMS TAKE PLACE IN SEVERAL VENUES SUCH AS SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, HOUSING UNITS, COMMUNITY CENTERS, CHURCHES AND SHOPPING AREAS. EACH ENCOUNTER IS INTENDED TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT COMMUNITY HEALTH AND RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. COMMUNICATION REGARDING COMMUNITY HEALTH ACTIVITIES IS IN THE FORM OF FLYERS, POSTERS, BUSINESS CARDS, TELEVISION, RADIO AND NEWSPRINT. HEALTH LITERACY IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN GENERATING ALL COMMUNITY HEALTH COMMUNICATIONS. AS WE CONTINUE WORKING TOWARD ACHIEVING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOALS FOR DELAWARE COUNTY WE MUST BUILD HEALTHY COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY (HEALTHCARE, BUSINESS, EDUCATION, GOVERNMENT, LAW ENFORCEMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHERS) RECOGNIZE AND EMBRACE THEIR PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH.

        <Explanation>INTRODUCTION ============ CKHS' MAJOR AREAS OF FOCUS INCLUDE: - IMPROVING THE OVERALL HEALTH STATUS OF RESIDENTS IN DELAWARE COUNTY. - MEASURING PROGRESS OF KEY HEALTH INDICATORS, AS IDENTIFIED IN HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010, AND REPORTING THESE TRENDS OVER TIME. THE FOLLOWING LEADING HEALTH INDICATORS CHOSEN TO BE ADDRESSED BY CKHS REFLECT THE MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS IN DELAWARE COUNTY: - ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE - MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH - RESPONSIBLE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR - CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT - EARLY DETECTION OF CANCER - IMPROVED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH - INJURY/VIOLENCE PREVENTION - WELLNESS/FITNESS - TARGETING RISK REDUCTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION INTERVENTIONS. MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY ======================= TOOLS USED BY CKHS TO DETERMINE THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT CKHS SERVES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: - PHILADELPHIA HEALTH MANAGEMENT CORPORATION HOUSEHOLD FIELD SURVEY - BRFSS - BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SURVEY - NCHS - NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS - BUREAU OF THE CENSUS - STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF THE U.S. - PA VITAL STATISTICS - PA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH - NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY - COMMUNITY SURVEYS - FAITH BASED COMMUNITY SURVEYS STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS FINDINGS ============================== CKHS RESPONDS TO THE DATA IT RECEIVES REGARDING THE COMMUNITIES IT SERVES BY THE FOLLOWING: - EVALUATE PROVEN STRATEGIES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. - IF NO PROVEN STRATEGIES EXIST, DESIGN NEW PROGRAMS/OUTREACH MEASURES USING STRATEGIES PROVEN TO WORK WITH REGARD TO SIMILAR HEALTH ISSUES OR WITHIN SIMILAR COMMUNITIES. - EVALUATE PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING 2010 GOALS. - IDENTIFY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTNERS. -COORDINATE AND COLLABORATE WITH INTERNAL/EXTERNAL PARTNERS TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEED. - INCLUDE PARTNERS, AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY CKHS PLANS TO SERVE IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION PHASE OF THE "ROLL-OUT" OF THE PROGRAM. - DESIGN NEW PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS OBSERVED NEED - INCLUDING A TOOL TO EVALUATE OUTREACH EFFORTS. - PLAN STRATEGIES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. PROCESS ======= CROZER-KEYSTONE HEALTH SYSTEM RESPONDS TO THE COMMUNITY'S IDENTIFIED NEEDS BY SEEKING OUT PARTNERSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WILL TARGET THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS. SELECTION OF STAFF TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE INDIVIDUAL AND CULTURAL COMPOSITION OF THE COMMUNITIES TO BE SERVED. CKHS HAS FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFY MORE CLOSELY AND ARE MORE INCLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS WHERE THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OF SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. ONCE STAFF IS SELECTED, TRAINING AND SUPERVISION OCCUR ON AN ON-GOING BASIS TO ASSURE THAT TARGETED GOALS ARE BEING MET AND THAT THE COMMUNITY IS POSITIVELY RESPONDING TO PROGRAMS. COMMUNITY PROGRAMS TAKE PLACE IN SEVERAL VENUES SUCH AS SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, HOUSING UNITS, COMMUNITY CENTERS, CHURCHES AND SHOPPING AREAS. EACH ENCOUNTER IS INTENDED TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT COMMUNITY HEALTH AND RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. COMMUNICATION REGARDING COMMUNITY HEALTH ACTIVITIES IS IN THE FORM OF FLYERS, POSTERS, BUSINESS CARDS, TELEVISION, RADIO AND NEWSPRINT. HEALTH LITERACY IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN GENERATING ALL COMMUNITY HEALTH COMMUNICATIONS. AS CKHS CONTINUES WORKING TOWARD ACHIEVING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOALS FOR DELAWARE COUNTY CKHS MUST BUILD HEALTH COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY (HEALTHCARE, BUSINESS, EDUCATION, GOVERNMENT, LAW ENFORCEMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHERS) RECOGNIZE AND EMBRACE THEIR PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH. A TRULY HEALTHY COMMUNITY REQUIRES A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BY ALL THE SHAREHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY. CKHS IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL WHO LIVE, WORK AND PLAY IN DELAWARE COUNTY. SELECTED ACCOMPLISHMENTS ======================== CHESTER UPLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT/CKHS ALLIED HEALTH HIGH SCHOOL ------------------------------------------------------------- THIS SCHOOL A COLLABORATE EFFORT PREPARES AND MOTIVATES STUDENTS TO PURSUE FURTHER EDUCATION TOWARD A CAREER IN THE MEDICAL SCIENCES THROUGH SPECIALIZED CURRICULUM AND COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERSHIPS. STUDENTS WILL HAVE BOTH THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES IN THE HEALTH SCIENCES. 2009-2010 THE SCHOOL OPENED UP WITH ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR ADDING 100 NEW STUDENTS. MANY STUDENTS ARE CPR CERTIFIED AND MANY STUDENTS ARE TAKING THEIR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES EXAM. ALL STUDENTS WILL EARN AN EMT AND CNA CERTIFICATION UPON GRADUATION. SMEDLEY HIGH SCHOOL FOR HEALTH CAREERS UPDATE ---------------------------------------------- BACKGROUND INFORMATION: NINETY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS THAT ATTEND SMEDLEY HIGH SCHOOL FOR HEALTH CAREERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH UNDER THE FEDERAL TITLE I PROGRAM. MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT ATTEND SMEDLEY LIVE WITH GRANDPARENTS OR EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS. AT THE END OF THE 2010 SCHOOL YEAR, THREE STUDENTS LIVED IN HOMELESS SHELTERS. THE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE HEALTH CAREERS PROGRAM ARE BEING PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK THE CHAINS OF POVERTY THAT HAVE PLAGUED THEIR FAMILY GENERATION AFTER GENERATION . THE MAJORITY OF THE SMEDLEY 2012 GRADUATES WILL BE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILIES TO ATTEND COLLEGE. THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS HAVE NEVER LEFT THE CITY LIMITS OF CHESTER. THROUGH FIELD TRIPS, AND THE GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LOCAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS, STUDENTS ARE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE OTHER CULTURES AND OTHER PLACES. THREE TO FIVE FIELD TRIPS A YEAR ARE PLANNED FOR EACH GRADE LEVEL. SCHOOL COMPETITIONS AND AWARDS: - THE HEALTH CAREERS STUDENTS BEAT OUT THREE OTHER DELAWARE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS AT THE 2ND ANNUAL DELAWARE COUNTY READING OLYMPICS. - HEALTH CAREERS STUDENTS WON THE DELAWARE COUNTY STROKE AWARENESS VIDEO AWARD. SEVERAL STUDENTS CREATED A VIDEO THAT INFORMED THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF STROKE AWARENESS. - THIRTY-FIVE STUDENTS WON THE CITY OF CHESTER'S MAYOR'S AWARD FOR THEIR HIGH ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS. NO OTHER SCHOOL HAD THIS LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR THIS ANNUAL AWARD. - OVER HALF OF THE STUDENTS IN EACH GRADE SIGNED UP TO TAKE AN HONORS COURSE IN EITHER: MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, HISTORY OR ENGLISH. - HEALTH CAREERS STUDENTS CREATE LITERATURE TO DISTRIBUTE AND SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY ABOUT SEVERAL HEALTH RELATED TOPICS RANGING FROM STD'S TO BREAST CANCER TO STROKE AWARENESS. - THE STUDENTS ALSO MADE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HAITI RELIEF FUND AND OTHER LOCAL CHARITIES. MEASURING STUDENT PROGRESS/4 SIGHT: NINETY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS IN THE HEALTH CAREERS PROGRAM ARE MEETING OR EXCEEDING THE STATE'S EXPECTATION IN BOTH READING AND MATHEMATICS. NO HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CHESTER-UPLAND DISTRICT HAS EVER ATTAINED THESE HIGH PERCENTAGES IN ANY SUBJECT AREA. HONOR ROLL: ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE SCHOOL HAS MADE THE HONOR ROLL THREE OUT OF FOUR MARKING PERIODS. STUDENTS AGREE THAT THE COURSES ARE RIGOROUS AND CHALLENGING. THE 2010-2011 SCHOOL YEAR WILL MARK THE START OF HONORS CLASSES AT SMEDLEY. THE FOLLOWING YEAR ADVANCED PLACEMENT CLASSES WILL BE OFFERED. GRADUATION RATE: SMEDLEY HIGH SCHOOL WILL HAVE 9TH, 10TH AND 11TH GRADERS IN THE 2010-2011 SCHOOL YEAR. EACH YEAR THE SCHOOL HAS PROMOTED EVERY STUDENT. NO STUDENT HAS EVER BEEN RETAINED. THE SCHOOL'S FOCUS AND GOAL IS TO HAVE EVERY SENIOR STUDENT GRADUATE IN 2012. CHESTER YOUTH COLLABORATIVE EXPANSION ------------------------------------- THE CHESTER YOUTH COLLABORATIVE (CYC) IS A CITY-WIDE NETWORK AIMED AT INCREASING THE QUALITY AND NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH IN CHESTER TO SUPPORT YOUTH IN TRANSITIONING INTO HEALTHY, PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. CROZER WELLNESS CENTER SERVES AS THE LEAD ORGANIZATION FOR THE NETWORK. CYC WAS LAUNCHED IN 2005 WITH A THREE-YEAR $1.1 MILLION GRANT FROM PHILADELPHIA'S WILLIAM PENN FOUNDATION. BECAUSE THE CROZER WELLNESS CENTER HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THE OUTCOMES DICTATED BY THE WILLIAM PENN FOUNDATION IN THE 2005 GRANT, A SECOND 3-YEAR GRANT WAS AWARDED IN SPRING 2008. AT $1.9 MILLION, THIS GRANT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE FIRST. PLEASE SEE CROZER WELLNESS CENTER'S INFORMATION BELOW FOR DETAILS.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>NEW MOMS/NEW PARENT PROJECT AND IDECIDE CAMPAIGN ------------------------------------------------ CROZER-KEYSTONE HEALTH SYSTEM'S WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH SERVICES IN DELAWARE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, WAS AWARDED A TWO-YEAR FEDERAL GRANT TO CREATE A SOCIAL MARKETING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. THIS WAS ONE OF THIRTEEN GRANTS AWARDED NATIONALLY, WITH THE CROZER-KEYSTONE GRANT BEING THE ONLY ONE AWARDED IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO LEARN WHAT SOCIAL MARKETING STRATEGIES WORK TOWARD PROMOTION AND EDUCATION ON PRECONCEPTION CARE AND MATERNAL HEALTH; BOTH CONTRIBUTING LONG TERM TO LOWERING THE INFANT MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY RATE IN DELAWARE COUNTY, PA. THIS SOCIAL MARKETING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WAS NAMED THE NEW MOMS/NEW PARENTS PROJECT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE NEW MOMS/NEW PARENTS PROJECT CREATED A HEALTH EDUCATION AND MARKETING CAMPAIGN TARGETING AN AUDIENCE OF 13-25 YEAR OLD WOMEN CALLED IDECIDE. THE IDECIDE CAMPAIGN HAS FOCUSED ON SEVEN MAIN HEALTH TOPICS WITHIN PRECONCEPTION CARE AND MATERNAL HEALTH INCLUDING: THE IMPORTANCE OF A MEDICAL HOME, SEXUAL HEALTH, SAFE RELATIONSHIPS, NUTRITION, EXERCISE, MENTAL HEALTH/STRESS, AND FOLIC ACID. ADDITIONALLY, THE IMPORTANCE OF GIRLS AND WOMEN TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES WELL BEFORE THEY GET PREGNANT OR CONSIDER PREGNANCY WAS ALSO STRESSED IN ORDER TO HELP INCREASE THE CHANCES THAT IN THE FUTURE THEY WILL HAVE A HEALTHY BABY. THE GIRLS AND WOMEN THE CAMPAIGN TARGETED LIVED IN LOW INCOME AREAS AND OFTEN LACKED THE HEALTH LITERACY AND AWARENESS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BE HEALTHY AND HOW TO STAY HEALTHY. TO CREATE THE IDECIDE CAMPAIGN AND TO VALIDATE THE PROJECT WITH DATA, THE PROJECT PARTNERED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (PHMC) TO CONDUCT EXTENSIVE FOCUS GROUPS AND STREET INTERCEPTS WITH THE IDENTIFIED TARGET AUDIENCE TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR OPINIONS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS PRECONCEPTION CARE, INTERCONCEPTION CARE, AND HEALTH IN GENERAL. THE PROCESS EVALUATION FOUND THAT GIRLS AND WOMEN AGED 13-25 FELT THAT THEY WERE OFTEN TOO BUSY TO EAT HEALTHY AND THAT MOST WOMEN THEIR AGE ATE POORLY OUT OF CONVENIENCE. THOSE SURVEYED ALSO EXPRESSED THAT THEY FELT THAT ALL OF THE PROJECT'S THEMES WERE IMPORTANT, BUT BECAUSE LIFE IS OFTEN BUSY AND HECTIC, IT IS HARD TO STAY PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY, AND SEXUALLY HEALTHY. LAST, THEY FELT THAT PREGNANCY AND SEXUAL HEALTH NEEDED TO BE DISCUSSED MORE WITH TEENS. PHMC ALSO CONDUCTED A FOCUS GROUP WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO GAUGE PROBLEMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS IN THE AGE RANGE, AS WELL AS TO LEARN WHAT AREAS DOCTORS AND CARE GIVERS FELT THAT GIRLS 13-25 LACKED IN KNOWLEDGE. WHILE TEEN PREGNANCY HAS BEEN SLOWLY DECLINING IN PENNSYLVANIA, THERE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CHESTER. WITH THE IDECIDE CAMPAIGN, IT WAS HOPED THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED WOULD HELP TO DECREASE TEEN UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES AND HELP EMPOWER GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN TO HELP THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. ONCE THE RESEARCH WAS EVALUATED, THE PROJECT BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERACTIVE IDECIDE CAMPAIGN. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS TO CONDUCT HEALTH PRESENTATIONS IN DELAWARE COUNTY SCHOOLS ABOUT THE IDENTIFIED FOCUS TOPICS. THE PROCESS BEGAN BY CONTACTING MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTY TO MARKET THE CAMPAIGN AND PROMOTE INTEREST. ONCE A SCHOOL WAS INTERESTED IN THE CAMPAIGN, SPECIFIC SCHOOL NEED WAS DETERMINED. THE MOST POPULAR FOCUS TOPIC WAS NUTRITION FOLLOWED BY SAFE RELATIONSHIPS. BY TALKING WITH THE SCHOOLS, PROJECT STAFF LEARNED OF ADDITIONAL AREAS TO PRESENT THAT SCHOOLS FELT WERE "PROBLEM AREAS" WITHIN THE STUDENT BODY. FROM THESE MEETINGS, ADDITIONAL PRESENTATIONS WERE ADDED TO THE CAMPAIGN ON HYGIENE, BODY IMAGE, AND CYBER BULLYING. PRESENTATIONS LASTED FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR AND WERE COMPLETELY INTERACTIVE INCLUDING VIDEOS, ACTIVITIES, AND ROLE-PLAYING SITUATIONS. TO MEASURE THE OUTCOMES OF THE HEALTH PRESENTATION, PHMC CREATED A PRE-TEST AND A POST-TEST ASKING GIRLS QUESTIONS REGARDING ATTITUDES, KNOWLEDGE, AND BEHAVIORS. IN ADDITION TO HEALTH PRESENTATIONS IN SCHOOLS, THE PROJECT ALSO LAUNCHED AN EXTENSIVE VIRTUAL CAMPAIGN. BY USING NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS FACEBOOK, TWITTER, AND AN INTERACTIVE WEBSITE, THE CAMPAIGN WAS ABLE TO REACH THE TARGET AUDIENCE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH TOOLS THAT THEY USE EVERY DAY. FOR THE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK SITES, THE CAMPAIGN PUBLISHED A "TIP OF THE DAY" THAT RELATED TO THE HEALTH TOPICS. THE CAMPAIGN ALSO IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO ENGAGE THE AUDIENCE THROUGH DISCUSSION QUESTIONS ON A MESSAGE BOARD AS WELL AS COMMENTS TO THEIR ACTUAL PAGES. WITH THE WEBSITE, INTERACTIVE FEATURES WERE POSTED INCLUDING A HEALTH QUIZ, VIDEOS, HOT TOPICS, RESOURCES, AND UPCOMING EVENTS. WHEN WORKING WITH AN AUDIENCE WHOSE TRENDS CHANGE WEEKLY, IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO SPEAK IN A LANGUAGE THAT THE UNDERSTAND, THROUGH TOOLS THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO USE EFFECTIVELY. THROUGH THE PROJECT'S PRE AND POST- TEST EVALUATIONS, IT WAS LEARNED THAT THERE WERE SUCCESSES IN RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT THE TOPIC AREAS AND THAT THE GIRLS THAT PARTICIPATED ENJOYED THE STYLE AND LOOK OF THE IDECIDE CAMPAIGN. BY COMBINING THE VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS OF THE TEAM, USING NEW AND INNOVATIVE MEDIA, AND UTILIZING TRADITIONAL TIME-TESTED METHODS SUCH AS INTERACTIVE PRESENTATIONS, THE CAMPAIGN DEVELOPED A CUTTING-EDGE PROGRAM FOR THE TARGET AUDIENCE THAT WAS BOTH INTERESTING AND ENGAGING. THE NEW MOMS/NEW PARENTS PROJECT ENDED THE TWO-YEAR DEMONSTRATION PROJECT ON AUGUST 31, 2010. COMMUNITY PROGRAM ACTIVITIES FOR '09-'10 REACHED APPROXIMATELY 44,506 INDIVIDUALS IN THE PENNSYLVANIA, NEW JERSEY AND DELAWARE TRI-STATE AREA (DUE IN PART TO THE ELECTRONIC MEDIA COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT). TOBACCO PREVENTION ART CONTEST ------------------------------ THE TOBACCO PREVENTION &amp; CESSATION PROGRAM RECEIVED DONATIONS IN THE MEMORY OF A LOCAL RESIDENT KATHLEEN JONES. THESE FUNDS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR CKHS COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION'S TOBACCO PREVENTION AND CESSATION PROGRAM TO HOST AN ANTI-TOBACCO ART CONTEST FOR 10TH GRADERS IN THE CHESTER-UPLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT. MORE THAN 450 10TH GRADE STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WERE EDUCATED ABOUT THE DANGERS OF TOBACCO USE, TOBACCO MARKETING TACTICS TOWARDS YOUTH AND THE EFFECTS OF SECONDHAND SMOKE. THE STUDENTS CREATED A PIECE OF ART THAT WOULD PROMOTE A TOBACCO-FREE AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. ONE OF THE TOP ENTRIES SUMMED UP THE MESSAGE EMBODIED IN THIS OUTREACH PROGRAM FOR YOUNG ADULTS AS: "DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS END UP IN SMOKE!" IN THE COMING YEAR, THE PROGRAM WILL EDUCATE MORE YOUTHS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF TOBACCO USE TO PREVENT TODAY'S YOUTHS FROM BECOMING TOMORROW'S TOBACCO VICTIMS. DELAWARE COUNTY HEAD START COLLABORATION FOR NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OUTREACH ------------------------------------------------------------------- CKHS COMMUNITY HEALTH OFFERS PROGRAMMING TO MEET THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOALS OF DECREASING OBESITY AND INCREASING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION AND DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. PROGRAMS PROVIDE EDUCATION TO PROMOTE THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHFUL EATING, PORTION SIZE CONTROL, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IT IS BEST TO BEGIN EDUCATING CHILDREN ABOUT HEALTHFUL BEHAVIORS FROM AN EARLY AGE, AND THEREFORE CKHS COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERS WITH CHESPENN HEALTH SERVICES AND THE DELAWARE COUNTY INTERMEDIATE UNIT (DCIU) TO PROVIDE THIS EDUCATION TO ITS YOUNGEST STUDENTS. APPROXIMATELY 500 STUDENTS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 3 AND 5 IN DELAWARE COUNTY HEAD START PROGRAMS PARTICIPATED IN INTERACTIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON PROMOTING HEALTHFUL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS. THE PROGRAM IS IN ITS SECOND YEAR AND HAS BEEN WELL RECEIVED BY HEAD START FACILITIES AND THE DCIU. THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE AND LOOKS TO EXPAND ITS REACH WITHIN THE COMING YEAR. BODY AND SOUL: A CELEBRATION OF HEALTHY LIVING FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN CHURCHES ------------------------------------------------------------------- THE CKHS COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM WAS CHOSEN BY THE PA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BODY AND SOUL PROGRAM. CKHS COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS HAS A LONG STANDING POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHESTER AND VICINITY MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES AND PARISH NURSES IN CHESTER WHICH ENABLED THE PROGRAM TO ENLIST FIVE LOCAL CHURCHES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BODY AND SOUL PROGRAM. BODY AND SOUL IS A WELLNESS PROGRAM FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES. IT IS A PROVEN PROGRAM THAT EMPOWERS CHURCH MEMBERS TO LIVE HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>THE CKHS STAFF EDUCATED CHURCH MEMBERS REGARDING WAYS TO MAKE PERMANENT CHANGES IN DAILY LIVING FOR BETTER HEALTH AND CANCER PREVENTION, INCLUDING EATING A DIET RICH IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND INCREASING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE CHURCHES WERE THEN SUPPORTED BY THE CKHS STAFF AS THEY IMPLEMENTED ACTIVITIES THAT ENCOURAGED CHURCH MEMBERS TO INCORPORATE THE CONCEPTS LEARNED INTO EVERYDAY LIVING, CHURCH ACTIVITIES AND CHURCH POLICY. THE ACTIVITIES INCLUDED SUCH THINGS AS TASTE-TESTINGS OF HEALTHY FOODS, SERVING HEALTHY FOODS AT CHURCH FUNCTIONS, AND EXERCISE CLASSES. THE PROGRAM WAS AN ENORMOUS SUCCESS AT EACH CHURCH. CHURCHES WERE OFFERED SMALL STIPENDS TO PAY FOR THE PURCHASE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, EXERCISE VIDEOS, DOOR PRIZES, ETC. AS A RESULT OF THIS PROGRAM'S SUCCESS, SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WERE AWARDED TO INCLUDE A TOBACCO EDUCATION COMPONENT TO THE SERVICES OFFERED TO CHESTER BODY AND SOUL CHURCHES. KEEPING OUR BODIES HEALTHY - TOBACCO AWARENESS IS A CULTURALLY-APPROPRIATE TOBACCO EDUCATION SESSION BASED ON THE PATHWAYS TO FREEDOM GUIDE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THE CKHS STAFF EDUCATED CHURCH MEMBERS ON THE IMPACT OF TOBACCO USE ON THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY; HOW TOBACCO PRODUCTS AFFECT THE BODY; WAYS TO QUIT SUCCESSFULLY OR HELP LOVED-ONES AS THEY QUIT; AND CULTURALLY-TAILORED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE CHURCH. CHESTER HOME ASTHMA PREVENTION PROGRAM -------------------------------------- FUNDING WAS APPROVED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY FOR A THREE-YEAR PILOT PROGRAM THAT HAS ENABLED THE KIDS ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO ADD A NEW COMPONENT TO ACCENTUATE THEIR CURRENT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH EFFORTS FOR CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA LIVING IN CHESTER. THE PROGRAM ENTITLED CHESTER HOME ASTHMA PREVENTION PROGRAM IS A HOME BASED ASTHMA ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGER EDUCATION AND REMEDIATION SERVICE OFFERED TO CHESTER CITY RESIDENTS.

CROZER K.A.M.P. (KIDS ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM) ------------------------------------------------ K.A.M.P. WAS CREATED IN RESPONSE TO FINDING THAT CHESTER'S STUDENTS WERE EXPERIENCING ASTHMA AT RATES THAT WERE TYPICAL OF LARGE LOW-INCOME, MINORITY, INNER-CITY POPULATIONS (I.E. AT LEAST TWICE THE RATE OF CHILDREN ACROSS THE NATION). ASTHMA, A CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE THAT IS A LEADING CAUSE OF SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM IN CHILDREN, AFFECTS LOW-INCOME, AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN DISPROPORTIONATELY. WITH COMPLICATIONS RANGING FROM MILD TO LIFE-THREATENING, CHILDHOOD ASTHMA INTERRUPTS SLEEP, DISRUPTS FAMILY ROUTINES AND UNNECESSARILY RESTRICTS CHILDHOOD ACTIVITIES. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DR. GERALD KOLSKI, A PEDIATRIC ASTHMA SPECIALIST, A PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED IN COLLABORATION WITH CHESTER UPLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT (CUSD) IN 1999 TO REDUCE THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF ASTHMA ON CHESTER'S STUDENTS. DURING EIGHT YEARS OF SUCCESSFUL OPERATION, K.A.M.P. HAS PROVIDED COMPREHENSIVE, SCHOOL-BASED ASTHMA DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES TO MORE THAN 13,223 CHILDREN IN THE DISTRICT AS WELL AS IN TWO LOCAL PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. THE PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED INTO THE CHICHESTER SCHOOL DISTRICT IN 2006 AND TO THE UPPER DARBY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN 2008. A VARIETY OF AGE-APPROPRIATE EDUCATION CURRICULA DEVELOPED BY THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND THE ASTHMA AND ALLERGY FOUNDATION ARE USED TO EDUCATE CHILDREN ABOUT MANAGING THEIR ASTHMA. THE PROGRAM HAS ENHANCED THE CHILDREN'S SAFETY (AS WELL AS PARENT AND SCHOOL PERSONNEL PEACE OF MIND) BY PROVIDING MEDICATIONS (WHEN APPROVED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS), PEAK FLOW METERS, AND OTHER TOOLS FOR EFFECTIVE ASTHMA MANAGEMENT TO ENROLLEES, SCHOOL NURSES, AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS, ALONG WITH INSTRUCTIONS IN THEIR USE. ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SESSIONS HAVE HELPED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ASTHMA TRIGGERS IN THE SCHOOLS AND ELIMINATE OR REDUCE EXPOSURE TO THESE HAZARDS. A NEW K.A.M.P. PROGRAM MANAGER WAS HIRED IN JANUARY 2010. SUBSEQUENT TO HER ORIENTATION AND MEETINGS WITH SCHOOL NURSES IN ALL THREE DISTRICTS THE NEW K.A.M.P. PROGRAM MANAGER CONDUCTED 16 ASTHMA PRESENTATIONS FOR STUDENTS, PARENTS AND SCHOOL STAFF, INCLUDING TWO OPEN AIRWAYS SERIES FOR GRADES 1-5 AT SENKOW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, REACHING A TOTAL OF 745 PARTICIPANTS DURING THESE PRESENTATIONS. ASTHMA AWARENESS MONTH WAS PROMOTED AT PRESENTATIONS DURING MAY 2010. PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS INCLUDED GARRETTFORD, DREXEL NEUMAN, STONEHURST, BEVERLY HILLS, BYWOOD AND HIGHLAND PARK. ADDITIONALLY THE KELLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL'S PRESENTATION INCORPORATED AN ASTHMA SCREENING FOR FIRST AND SECOND GRADERS. THE K.A.M.P. PROGRAM MANAGER PROMOTED AND HELPED STAFF CROZER-KEYSTONE'S ANNUAL SUMMER ASTHMA DAY CAMP AT THE HEATHPLEX SPORTS CLUB.

        <Explanation>DCMH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL PREVENTION PROGRAM ------------------------------------------------------------- AS A COMMUNITY SERVICE, THE DELAWARE COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPT. OFFERS THE DRUG AND ALCOHOL PREVENTION PROGRAM, WHICH ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING ALCOHOL AND DRUG AWARENESS AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN, TEENAGERS AND THEIR FAMILIES: INHALANT ABUSE AWARENESS, ALCOHOL ABUSE AWARENESS, AND PARTY DRUG ABUSE AWARENESS. NEW THIS YEAR IS A BULLYING PROGRAM THAT WAS PILOTED TO 500 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN FOUR SCHOOLS (TWO PUBLIC SCHOOLS/TWO PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS). THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON IDENTIFYING WHAT BULLYING IS; WHY PEOPLE BULLY; AND THE EFFECTS OF BULLYING. IT IS AN INTERACTIVE PROGRAM ABOUT BULLYING BOTH IN SCHOOL AND OUT OF SCHOOL AND THE IMPACT BULLYING CAN HAVE ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND THE COMMUNITY. IT ALSO IDENTIFIES HOW ONE'S PERCEPTION OF AN INDIVIDUAL MAY BE MISLEADING. MORE WORK WILL BE DONE WITH THIS PROGRAM IN THE UPCOMING YEAR TO DEVELOP MEASUREMENT TOOLS TO VALIDATE THE PROGRAM'S IMPACT.

CROZER WELLNESS CENTER ---------------------- IN ADDITION TO THE MEDICAL SERVICES IT PROVIDES TO THE COMMUNITY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF RIMA HIMELSTEIN, M.D., THE CROZER WELLNESS CENTER ADMINISTERS EXTENSIVE RISK-REDUCTION AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CHESTER CITY. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY FUNDED THROUGH GRANTS AND, AS A RESULT, THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS OFFERED IN THE COMMUNITY SHIFT SOMEWHAT EACH YEAR ACCORDING TO FUNDS. REGARDLESS OF SHIFTS IN PROGRAMMING, THE WELLNESS CENTER'S APPROACH TO COMMUNITY HEALTH REMAINS CONSTANT: WE USE PRINCIPLES OF POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE LONG-TERM HEALTH AND LIFE OUTCOMES OF YOUTH. (POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT EMPHASIZES BUILDING STRENGTHS OF YOUTH RATHER THAN FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON RISK BEHAVIOR. POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT ALSO INCLUDES AN EMPHASIS ON PROVIDING YOUTH WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEADERSHIP IN PROGRAMMING AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD MARKETABLE SKILLS THROUGH REAL-WORLD ACTIVITIES). IN FISCAL 2010 CROZER WELLNESS CENTER'S EFFORTS FELL INTO 2 AREAS: 1) OUT-OF-SCHOOL YOUTH PROGRAMS AND 2) CITY-WIDE INITIATIVES. OUT-OF-SCHOOL YOUTH PROGRAMS ---------------------------- THERE IS A WIDE RANGE IN WHAT OUT-OF-SCHOOL PROGRAMS CAN LOOK LIKE. CROZER WELLNESS CENTER'S NICHE AMONG SUCH PROGRAMS IS IN YOUTH LEADERSHIP. WE WORK WITH RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBERS OF YOUTH (30-50 PER PROGRAM) OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (YEARS, AS OPPOSED TO WEEKS OR MONTHS), TRAINING THEM TO TAKE ON HIGH PROFILE LEADERSHIP ROLES IN THE COMMUNITY. EVALUATION OF PROGRAMS FOCUSES ON LONG TERM OUTCOMES RELATED TO RISK TAKING BEHAVIOR AS WELL AS SHORT-TERM AND INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES CUSTOMIZED FOR EACH PROGRAM (EXAMPLES INCLUDE INCREASED WORKFORCE SKILLS, CONNECTION TO SUPPORTIVE ADULTS, CONNECTION TO POSITIVE PEERS, AND COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION). OUT-OF-SCHOOL PROGRAMS OFFERED IN FISCAL 2010 WERE: - CHESTER YOUTH COUNCIL: THE YOUTH COUNCIL IS ONE AREA WITHIN A LARGER, CITY-WIDE INITIATIVE LED BY CROZER WELLNESS CENTER: THE CHESTER YOUTH COLLABORATIVE (SEE CITY-WIDE INITIATIVES, BELOW). THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE 2005. THE PURPOSE OF THE YOUTH COUNCIL IS TO CHANGE PERCEPTIONS OF AND ABOUT CHESTER YOUTH AND TO INSPIRE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AMONG OTHER YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY. YOUTH AGED 12-22 MAY BECOME MEMBERS BY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING 80 HOURS OF BASELINE TRAINING. ONCE INDUCTED, YOUTH COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE ASSIGNED TO TEAMS AND TEAMS ARE ASSIGNED TO WORK ON VARIOUS CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY (FOR EXAMPLE, BEING VOTING MEMBERS ON BOARDS OF COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION PROJECTS, PLANNING AND HOSTING THE ANNUAL CHESTER YOUTH EMPOWERMENT SUMMIT OR FACILITATING FORUMS WITH CHESTER YOUTH AT LARGE TO IDENTIFY ISSUES OF CONCERNS). IN ADDITION TO BASELINE TRAINING, MEMBERS TAKE PART ON ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND PERSONAL ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES OVER THE COURSE OF EACH YEAR. IN FISCAL 2009 THE YOUTH COUNCIL ENGAGED 30 YOUTH FOR A MEAN OF 59 HOURS (MINIMUM OF 3 HOURS; MAXIMUM OF 125 HOURS). 68% OF MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ENROLLED FOR ONE OR MORE YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE YOUTH COUNCIL'S ANNUAL ONE-DAY YOUTH LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE, THE CHESTER YOUTH EMPOWERMENT SUMMIT, HAD 579 YOUTH AND ADULTS IN ATTENDANCE. - BLUEPRINTS/PEER LEADER PROGRAM: BLUEPRINTS IS AN OUT-OF SCHOOL PROGRAM OPERATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SWARTHMORE COLLEGE'S BLACK CULTURAL CENTER. FISCAL 2009 WAS THE 3RD YEAR OF THE BLUEPRINTS PROGRAM. MEMBERS WERE IN 7TH GRADE WHEN THE PROGRAM STARTED, AND IN 9TH GRADE IN FISCAL 2009. SWARTHMORE COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE RESPONSIBLE TO FACILITATE TUTORING, MENTORING AND CULTURAL ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES. CROZER WELLNESS CENTER STAFF MEMBERS WERE RESPONSIBLE TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY SERVICES EXPERIENCES (MEMBERS VOLUNTEERED AT CHESTER CO-OP), TO PROVIDE MEMBERS WITH LIFE SKILLS &amp; RISK REDUCTION EDUCATION, TO TRAIN PARTICIPANTS TO TAKE ON THE ROLE OF PEER EDUCATORS OR "PEER LEADERS", AND TO COORDINATE SPECIAL/FAMILY/RECOGNITION EVENTS. IN THEIR ROLE OF PEER LEADERS, MEMBERS WILL PRESENT WORKSHOPS ON LIFE SKILLS AND RISK TAKING BEHAVIORS TO 6TH GRADE STUDENTS IN THE CHESTER UPLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN FISCAL 2010 THE BLUEPRINTS/PEER LEADER PROGRAM ENGAGED 33 YOUTH FOR A MEAN OF 150 HOURS (MINIMUM OF 5 HOURS; MAXIMUM OF 313 HOURS). 52% OF THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN ENROLLED SINCE THE BLUEPRINTS PROGRAM BEGAN 4 YEARS AGO. - CROZER MENTORING PROGRAM: CROZER MENTORING PROGRAM LINKS CHESTER UPLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS (GRADES 9-12) WITH ELEMENTARY STUDENTS AT COLUMBUS SCHOOL. FISCAL 2010 WAS THE 2ND YEAR OF THE PROGRAM. MENTEES WERE IN 5TH GRADE. PRIMARY FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM WILL ALLOW MENTORS TO WORK WITH THE SAME GROUP OF MENTEES FOR THREE YEARS, UNTIL THEY COMPLETE 7TH GRADE. FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF BASELINE TRAINING EACH MENTOR IS MATCHED WITH 2-4 MENTEES. MENTORS MEET WITH THEIR MENTEES IN A SMALL GROUP FOR ONE HOUR EACH WEEK, UNDER SUPERVISION OF CROZER WELLNESS CENTER STAFF. MENTORS ENGAGE THEIR MENTEES IN SMALL GROUP ACTIVITIES BASED ON EDUCATIONAL AND/OR PERSONAL ENRICHMENT WITH THEMES FOR EACH MONTH (FOR EXAMPLE SUBSTANCE ABUSE, PERSONAL HYGIENE, OR RESTAURANT MANNERS). IN ADDITION TO CLASSROOM SESSIONS MENTORS AND THEIR MENTEES PARTICIPATE TOGETHER IN FIELD TRIPS AND SPECIAL/FAMILY EVENTS DURING AND AFTER SCHOOL HOURS. DURING FISCAL 2009 THE CROZER MENTORING PROGRAM ENGAGED 49 MENTORS FOR A MEAN OF 19 HOURS (MINIMUM OF 1 HOUR; MAXIMUM OF 41 HOURS). - CROZER WELLNESS CENTER ALUMNI FELLOWSHIP: THE WELLNESS CENTER FELLOWSHIP IS A PAID INTERNSHIP THAT IS OPEN TO ALUMNI OF THE WELLNESS CENTER ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS: TWO HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS PER YEAR ARE AWARDED SLOTS IN THE PROGRAM FOLLOWING THEIR GRADUATION. COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE PART OF THE FELLOWSHIP ARE ASSIGNED TO VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE HEALTH SYSTEM DURING THEIR SUMMER AND WINTER VACATIONS, UP TO 30 HOURS PER WEEK. THE GOALS OF THE WELLNESS CENTER FELLOWSHIP ARE TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONAL WORK EXPERIENCES, TO INCREASE THE PROFESSIONAL SKILL SET OF PARTICIPANTS, TO GROOM YOUTH WITH LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL FOR POSITIONS IN CKHS, AND TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF INCOME FOR STUDENTS DURING COLLEGE. STUDENTS MUST REMAIN ENROLLED IN COLLEGE AND MAINTAIN A STRONG GRADE POINT AVERAGE TO STAY IN THE PROGRAM. DURING FISCAL 2010 HOST DEPARTMENTS INCLUDED SOCIAL WORK, MARKETING, NURSING AND COMMUNITY HEALTH. TO DATE 6 STUDENTS HAVE GRADUATED FROM THE PROGRAM, AND 5 OF THE 6 HAVE USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE PAID POSITIONS WITHIN CKHS OUTSIDE THEIR FELLOWSHIP HOURS, SOME EVEN BEFORE THEIR COLLEGE GRADUATION. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OF PARTICIPANTS CONDUCTED BY THEIR HOST DEPARTMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT STUDENTS' PROFESSIONAL SKILL SETS INCREASE STEADILY OVER THEIR YEARS IN THE PROGRAM. IN FISCAL 2010 THE CROZER WELLNESS CENTER ALUMNI FELLOWSHIP ENGAGED PARTICIPANTS IN 1,920 HOURS.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>CITY-WIDE INITIATIVES --------------------- SINCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1996 THE CROZER WELLNESS CENTER HAS EARNED A REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY AND REGION FOR OPERATING HIGH-QUALITY YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WITH SOLID OUTCOMES. AS A RESULT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEADING TWO LARGE, CITY-WIDE INITIATIVES IN CHESTER.

AS A RESULT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEADING TWO LARGE, CITY-WIDE INITIATIVES IN CHESTER. IN FISCAL 2010 THESE INCLUDED: - CHESTER YOUTH COLLABORATIVE: IN 2002 THE CHESTER YOUTH COLLABORATIVE (CYC) WAS ESTABLISHED WITH SUPPORT FROM PHILADELPHIA'S WILLIAM PENN FOUNDATION. THE GOALS OF THE INITIATIVE ARE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF YOUTH SERVING ORGANIZATIONS AND TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-QUALITY YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH IN CHESTER, TO SUPPORT YOUTH IN BECOMING HEALTHY, PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. THE COLLABORATIVE IS A CITY-WIDE NETWORK CONSISTING OF ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING OUT-OF-SCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR CHESTER YOUTH AGES 12-22, YOUTH AGES 12-22 THEMSELVES (SEE OUT-OF-SCHOOL PROGRAMS: CHESTER YOUTH COUNCIL, ABOVE), PARENTS/COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS IN CHESTER. EACH OF THESE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WORKS ON SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE CYC. IN THE FIRST 3 YEARS KEY DELIVERABLES WERE RELATED TO ESTABLISHING THE NETWORK AS WELL AS ITS INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS, COORDINATING AND LAUNCHING A WEB-BASED DATA SYSTEM AMONG YOUTH SERVING ORGANIZATIONS IN CYC, ESTABLISHING A MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND COACHING TO YOUTH SERVING ORGANIZATIONS TO INCREASE SCORES ON ASSESSMENTS, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CHESTER YOUTH PARTICIPATING IN PROGRAMS OFFERED BY CYC MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF YOUTH INVOLVED IN POSITIONS OF INFLUENCE AMONG CYC MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS AND THROUGHOUT THE CITY. BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE INITIATIVE, CHESTER CITY COUNCIL PASSED A RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING CYC AS THE OFFICIAL YOUTH DEVELOPMENT RESOURCE FOR THE CITY- AN OUTCOME BEYOND THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE WILLIAM PENN FOUNDATION. IN RECOGNITION OF CROZER WELLNESS CENTER'S SUCCESS AS THE LEAD ORGANIZATION FOR THE CYC, WILLIAM PENN FOUNDATION AWARDED A SECOND 3-YEAR GRANT IN SPRING 2008.

        <Explanation>NUTRITION AND BREASTFEEDING GOALS FOR THE 09-10 FY INCLUDE: - NUTRITION EDUCATION IS DONE WITH ALL WIC CLIENTS A MINIMUM OF 4 TIMES/YEAR DURING THEIR SCHEDULED WIC APPOINTMENTS. IN RECENT YEARS THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO HELP PEOPLE CHANGE BEHAVIORS IN THEIR EATING HABITS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. SETTING GOALS TO INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS DISCUSSED WITH MOTHERS AND THEIR CHILDREN. PARENTS ALSO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THEIR CHILDREN'S BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). THIS CAN HELP ADDRESS THE INCREASING PROBLEM OF CHILDHOOD OBESITY. PARENTS SET GOALS TO INCREASE THEIR OWN OR THEIR CHILDREN' CONSUMPTION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THIS CAN INCREASE INTAKE OF VALUABLE NUTRIENTS AND LOWER CALORIES CONSUMED. PREGNANT WOMEN RECEIVE NUTRITION COUNSELING TO HELP ENSURE APPROPRIATE WEIGHT GAIN AND HEALTHY OUTCOME TO PREGNANCY. - WIC PROMOTES BREASTFEEDING TO ALL WOMEN WHO ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM. WE ARE STRIVING TO MEET THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOALS OF INCREASED BREASTFEEDING IN OUR NATION. WIC CLIENTS IN DELAWARE COUNTY HAVE INCREASED THE RATE OF MOMS WHO TRY BREASTFEEDING FROM 35% TO 58% OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS. THE RATE OF BREASTFEEDING IN DELAWARE COUNTY WIC WOMEN IS WELL ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE RATE FOR WIC WOMEN (56%). WIC SUPPLIES BREAST PUMPS TO HELP WOMEN CONTINUE WITH BREASTFEEDING FOR LONGER PERIODS. OVER 100 BREAST PUMPS WERE GIVEN TO WOMEN OVER THE LAST YEAR. WE ALSO WORK WITH OTHER GROUPS WHO HAVE CONTACT WITH PREGNANT AND NEW MOTHERS. THE CROZER NURSE-FAMILY PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN GIVEN INFORMATION TO HELP THEM SUPPORT MOM WHO ARE BREASTFEEDING. REFERRALS TO THEIR PROGRAM ARE GIVEN BY THE STAFF AT WIC. WIC CONTINUES TO REFER CLIENTS TO HEALTHY START AND WORKS WITH HEALTHY START STAFF TO PROMOTE BREASTFEEDING IN THE COMMUNITY. THE MARKETING/PUBLIC RELATIONS DEPARTMENT PROVIDES NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR FOR THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE FREE HEALTH FAIRS, PHYSICIAN-SPONSORED LECTURES AND SCREENINGS AT CKHS HOSPITALS AND FACILITIES, AS WELL AS OTHER LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT DELAWARE COUNTY (SUCH AS LIBRARIES, COMMUNITY CENTERS, ETC.). COMMUNITY OUTREACH ACTIVITIES FOR '09-'10 REACHED APPROXIMATELY 968 INDIVIDUALS. VOLUNTEER SERVICES ------------------ VOLUNTEER SERVICES AT CKHS OFFER NUMEROUS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AND TO THE PATIENTS AT OUR HOSPITALS. AMONG THESE SERVICES ARE MONTHLY BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENINGS, STUDENT MENTORING, PATIENT ADVOCACY, YOUTH LEADERSHIP, AND DONATION PROGRAMS. COMMUNITY OUTREACH ACTIVITIES FOR '09-'10 REACHED APPROXIMATELY 5,734 INDIVIDUALS. AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY -------------------- - MAJOR CHALLENGES: WE CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE OVERALL HEALTH STATUS OF OUR RESIDENTS AND THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN ACHIEVING HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES, GREATER USE OF PREVENTIVE CARE AND ADVANCES IN MEDICINE. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD ACHIEVING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 (HP2010) GOALS FOR DELAWARE COUNTY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMAIN AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS TOGETHER WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN THE GOAL OF OPTIMUM HEALTH FOR EVERY MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY: ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: THERE IS A SLIGHT INCREASE IN OVERALL ACCESS TO A SOURCE OF ONGOING HEALTHCARE IN DELAWARE COUNTY, YET WE ARE STILL NOT MEETING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 TARGET. GOOD NEWS IN THAT THE PERCENTAGES OF INDIVIDUALS HAVING A REGULAR SOURCE OF CARE ARE FAIRLY EVEN ACROSS THE RACES, SHOWING LESS DISPARITY THAN IN 2006. CKHS WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR ALL THE RESIDENTS OF DELAWARE COUNTY AND WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER THEIR CLINICS AT PEARL HALL AND ALSO CONTINUE THEIR PARTICIPATION ON THE DELAWARE COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE INSURE DELAWARE COUNTY'S CHILDREN TODAY TASK FORCE AND CHESPENN HEALTH SERVICES BOARD. OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY/PHYSICAL INACTIVITY: NOTED INCREASES IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY, AS WELL AS HIGH LEVELS OF PHYSICAL INACTIVITY CONTINUE TO REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. THESE RISK FACTORS, FOR MANY ACUTE AND CHRONIC DISEASES, CONTINUE TO PLAGUE INDIVIDUALS OF EVERY AGE, GENDER AND ETHNIC GROUP. THIS AFFECTS THE OVERALL HEALTH STATUS OF DELAWARE COUNTY, BOTH TODAY AND FOR THE FUTURE. CKHS'S HEALTHPLEX SPORTS CLUB OFFERS A SPACIOUS, STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY TO MEET ALL OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S HEALTH AND FITNESS NEEDS. FROM SWIMMING POOLS TO BASKETBALL COURTS TO THE BUSY FITNESS AREA, INDOOR TENNIS/SQUASH AND RACQUETBALL COURTS, NEW WAYS TO ENHANCE ONE'S HEALTH ARE DISCOVERED. THE HEALTHPLEX SPORTS CLUB IS DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF ITS MEMBERS AND THE COMMUNITY. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT (LBW): LOW BIRTH WEIGHT PERCENTAGES HIGHER THAN STATE AND NATIONAL PERCENTAGES. DELAWARE COUNTY'S RATE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS (8.8%) HAS DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 2002-04 STATUS (9.4%), BUT IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE STATE RATE (8.4 %) AND NATIONAL (8.2%) RATES AND STILL A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE FROM THE 5% TARGET RATE OF HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010. THE GREATEST DISPARITY IS NOTED AT BOTH THE COUNTY AND STATE LEVEL IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION WHERE THE RATE IS 5.2% GREATER AT THE COUNTY LEVEL (14%) AND 5.5% GREAT AT THE STATE LEVEL (13.9%). IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE INFANT DEATH RATE IS ALSO MUCH HIGHER IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION AT 15.3/1,000 VS. THE WHITE POPULATION OF 5.9/1,000 IN DELAWARE COUNTY. CKHS WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S HEALTHY START PROGRAM, THE CROZER OB/GYN CLINIC, THE DCMH MIDWIVES PROGRAM AND THE MANY CKHN OB/GYN PROVIDERS ENABLE WOMEN FROM DELAWARE COUNTY TO RECEIVE THE PRENATAL CARE THEY NEED TO ENSURE A HEALTHY BABY. CROZER-KEYSTONE ALSO OFFERS A LEVEL II NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE NURSERY AT DELAWARE COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, AND A LEVEL III INTENSIVE CARE NURSERY AT CROZER, THAT PROVIDE THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE NECESSARY FOR "HIGH RISK" BABIES TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE. TEEN PREGNANCY: THE TEEN PREGNANCY RATE FOR DELAWARE COUNTY IS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE STATE (21.8/1,000 DELCO VS. 22.2/1,000 PA). A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IS NOTED IN THE PERCENTAGE OF BIRTHS TO MOTHERS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 BETWEEN WHITE AND AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATIONS (WHITE -.9% VS. AFRICAN AMERICAN 6.8%). ALSO OF INTEREST ARE THE PERCENTAGES OF BIRTHS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 TO MOTHERS IN THE CITY OF CHESTER WHERE NUMBERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAT THOSE OF THE COUNTY (AFRICAN AMERICAN 9.1% AND HISPANIC 13.2%). CKHS CONTINUES TO OFFER PEER LED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING TO REDUCING ADOLESCENT RISK BEHAVIORS RELATED TO VIOLENCE, TEEN PREGNANCY, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES, AND USE OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND OTHER DRUGS THROUGH THE CROZER WELLNESS CENTER TO YOUTH IN CHESTER.

CKHS WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH SERVICES AND THE CROZER WELLNESS CENTER ARE PART OF THE DELAWARE COUNTY TEEN PREGNANCY COALITION, A COLLABORATIVE GROUP OF COUNTY PROVIDERS WHOSE AIM IS TO PREVENT TEEN PREGNANCY. EARLY PRENATAL CARE: RECEIVING EARLY AND ADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE STILL AN ISSUE FOR WOMEN IN DELAWARE COUNTY. THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN RECEIVING SOME TYPE OF PRENATAL CARE HAS DECREASED AGAIN SLIGHTLY (78.8%) WITH DISPARITIES BEING SEEN IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION (63.8%). THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN WHO RECEIVE EARLY AND ADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE (49.2% IN DELCO) CONTINUES TO DECREASE AND REMAINS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE PENNSYLVANIA RATE OF 66% AND THE HEALTHY PEOPLE TARGET OF 90%. CROZER-KEYSTONE WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH, HEALTHY START PROGRAM OFFERS ACCESS TO PRENATAL CARE, SUPPORT, CASE MANAGEMENT AND INFANT CARE TO PREGNANT WOMEN.

        <Explanation>CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS: INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN ARE AT HIGH RISK OF GETTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE; THAT IS WHY IT IS CRITICAL TO IMMUNIZE THEM AGAINST TWELVE DISEASES BEFORE THEY REACH THE AGE OF TWO. IN PENNSYLVANIA, WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO MEET THE HP2010 GOAL (90%) FOR CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION, WITH A CURRENT RATE OF 78.8% 4.3. CROZER-KEYSTONE'S CHILDREN'S HEALTH CONNECTION REMINDER PROGRAM PARTNERS WITH PARENTS TO INFORM AND REMIND THEM ABOUT DETAILS RELATED TO THEIR CHILD'S/CHILDREN'S HEALTH, GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT AND WELL BEING. THIS DATABASE DRIVEN PROGRAM USES AN AUTOMATED DELIVERY SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE AND MAIL POST CARDS TO PARENTS. THE POST CARDS ARE SENT BASED ON THE CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE (AT 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 AND 24 MONTHS) DURING THE EARLY CHILDHOOD YEARS TO INFORM PARENTS ABOUT WELL CHILD HEALTH VISITS, CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS, GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, NUTRITION, SAFETY AND MORE. AFTER THE SECOND BIRTHDAY, THE FAMILY WILL RECEIVE REMINDER CARDS EVERY YEAR DURING THE CHILD'S BIRTH MONTH UNTIL THE CHILD'S EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY. ADULT IMMUNIZATION (INFLUENZA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL): FLU VACCINATION RATES WENT UP IN 2007 BY 6% (73% OVERALL), HOWEVER WE ARE STILL NOT MEETING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOAL OF 90%. ALSO NOTED WAS A DISPARITY IN THE NON-WHITE POPULATION THE RATE OF IMMUNIZATION IN THIS GROUP IS ONLY 59%. PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA VACCINATION RATE IS HIGHER BY ABOUT 4% (70% OVERALL), HOWEVER, WE ARE STILL NOT MEETING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 TARGET OF 90%. AGAIN, A DISPARITY IS NOTED IN THE NON-WHITE POPULATION WHERE THE RATE OF IMMUNIZATION IS 55%. CKHS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATES IN THE DELAWARE COUNTY IMMUNIZATION COALITION COLLABORATIVE. CKHS PROVIDES FLU SHOTS TO HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC THROUGH OUR SENIOR HEALTH SERVICES PROGRAM, OUR CONGREGATIONAL NURSE INITIATIVE, AND THROUGH OUR CENTERS FOR FAMILY HEALTH. CANCER: THE OVERALL DEATH RATE FOR CANCER, AS WELL AS THE DEATH RATES FOR LUNG CANCER, BREAST CANCER, AND COLORECTAL CANCER SHOW THAT DELAWARE COUNTY CANCER DEATH RATES EXCEED THOSE RATES IN ALL PENNSYLVANIA COUNTIES. CONTINUED FOCUS ON EDUCATION, PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION OPPORTUNITIES IS NEEDED TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. CKHS'S REGIONAL CANCER CENTERS AT DELAWARE COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AND CROZER-CHESTER MEDICAL CENTER BRING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TOGETHER - PROVIDING A LEVEL OF CARE THAT RIVALS ANY UNIVERSITY-BASED CANCER CENTER IN THE WORLD. CKHS REGIONAL CANCER CENTERS HOUSE COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENTS PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS PREVENTION, EDUCATION AND COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT RESOURCES AND HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL WITH COMMENDATION BY THE COMMISSION ON CANCER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS. THE APPROACH TO TREATING PEOPLE WITH CANCER IS BASED UPON THE PATIENT'S INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. TO MEET THESE NEEDS, A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF SPECIALISTS THAT MAY INCLUDE MEDICAL ONCOLOGISTS, SURGEONS, PATHOLOGISTS AND RADIATION ONCOLOGISTS PROVIDE COORDINATED TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS. THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH COMPLETE CANCER CARE, NOT JUST CANCER TREATMENT. FOR THAT REASON, PATIENTS CAN ACCESS A RANGE OF SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST CANCER. SMOKING: RATE OF SMOKING AMONG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS AND ITS MAJOR IMPACT ON DISEASE AND DEATH CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE. DELAWARE COUNTY'S LUNG CANCER DEATH RATE IS 57.8 PER 100,000 ABOVE THE STATE RATE OF 53.4 PER 100,000 AND FAR FROM MEETING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOAL OF 44.9 PER 100,000. SLIGHT DECREASES ARE NOTED IN SMOKING RATES FOR ADULTS WITH OVERALL TOTAL OF 19.3%. THE 2008 STATUS SHOWS ADULT SMOKING RATES LEVELING OUT BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES, HOWEVER THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SMOKING RATE IS THE HIGHEST (24.5%) - AN INTERESTING POINT CONSIDERING THAT WHILE IN THE ADOLESCENT YEARS, THE ADOLESCENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN'S IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. NATIONALLY, THE ADOLESCENT RATES OVERALL HAVE DECREASED SINCE 2006 DATA COLLECTION, HOWEVER THE ONLY GROUP MEETING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOAL OF 16% IS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS (11.6%) WITH THE HISPANIC GROUP CLOSE TO MEETING THE GOAL (16.7%). IT IS NOTED THAT THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IS FOUND N THE WHITE ADOLESCENT GROUP (23.2%) - 3.2% ABOVE THE NATIONAL RATE OF ALL ADOLESCENTS. MALE ADOLESCENTS HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATES OF SMOKING THAN FEMALES (21.3% VS. 18.7%). THE PHMC HOUSEHOLD SURVEY FOR 2008 SHOWS THAT AMONG ADULTS 18+ WHO SMOKE, ONLY 60.1% WERE ADVISED TO QUIT SMOKING IN THE PAST YEAR AND THAT 15.6% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN DELAWARE COUNTY HAVE SOMEONE WHO SMOKES INSIDE THE HOME. CKHS COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION'S TOBACCO PREVENTION AND CESSATION PROGRAM RECEIVES FUNDING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO PROVIDE PREVENTION AND CESSATION PROGRAMMING TO YOUTH AND ADULTS AND FREE NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPIES TO ADULTS IN DELAWARE COUNTY. THE CROZER-KEYSTONE REGIONAL CANCER CENTERS' COMPREHENSIVE LUNG CANCER PROGRAMS PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THE PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND SUPPORT OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG CANCER. THE PROGRAMS ALSO INCLUDE RESEARCH VIA CLINICAL TRIALS, WHEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE. PROSTATE SCREENING: PROSTATE CANCER IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG MALES IN THE U.S. LOCAL DATA SHOWS A INCREASE IN RATE OF PROSTATE SCREENING FROM 60.8% IN 2006 TO 68.4% IN 2008; ONLY A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN (68.8%) AND LATINO (66.7%) POPULATIONS. THE LATINO RATE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FROM THE 2006 RATE (25.9%) - 2006 DATA COULD BE INACCURATE DUE TO A POTENTIAL SMALL SAMPLE SIZE. ALTHOUGH COUNTY-WIDE WE HAVE REACHED THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 RATE FOR PROSTATE SCREENING (28.8%), WE SEE DISPARITIES IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE POPULATION WITH HIGHER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY RATES NOTED FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES BOTH IN DELAWARE COUNTY AND AT THE STATE LEVEL, DESPITE THE HIGH RATE OF SCREENING IN THIS POPULATION EDUCATION AND SCREENING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES IS STILL GREATLY NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITY. CKHS REGIONAL CANCER SCREENINGS OFFERS FREE PROSTATE SCREENING ANNUALLY IN SEPTEMBER THAT IS OPEN TO RESIDENTS OF DELAWARE COUNTY. BREAST SCREENING: DELAWARE COUNTY HAS EXCEEDED THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2000 GOAL OF 60% FOR PHYSICAL BREAST EXAMS AND THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOAL OF 70% FOR MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING, HOWEVER THE DEATH RATE PER 100,000 FOR BREAST CANCER STILL SLIGHTLY EXCEEDS THAT OF THE STATE (27.2 DELCO VS. 27.0 PA). ALSO NOTEWORTHY IS THE FACT THAT WHILE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF SCREENINGS SEEMS TO BE DONE IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE INCIDENCE RATES ARE LOWER AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS; THE DEATH RATES PER 100,000 ARE HIGHER FOR THEM (36.5 DELCO VS. 35.9 PA). CKHS OFFERS STATE-OF-THE-ART MAMMOGRAPHY SERVICES. THE CKHS REGIONAL CANCER CENTERS HAVE PROGRAMS TO ASSIST WOMEN IN ACCESSING MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING DESPITE THE ABILITY TO PAY. COLORECTAL SCREENING THROUGH SIGMOIDOSCOPY: WE ARE CURRENTLY EXCEEDING THE HP2010 GOAL FOR COLORECTAL SCREENING OVERALL FOR THE COUNTY. ALSO NOTED IS THAT DESPITE MEETING THE SCREENING GOAL OVERALL, ONLY SMALL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN REALIZED IN THE DEATH RATE PER 100,000 FROM COLORECTAL CANCER (21.6 DELCO) WHERE WE CONTINUE TO EXCEED THE STATE RATE (20.1 PA) AND FAR EXCEED THE EXPECTED RATE FOR HP2010 (13.9). CONTINUED EDUCATION, OUTREACH AND SCREENING ARE NEEDED IN THIS AREA. CKHS REGIONAL CANCER CENTERS OFFER FREE COLORECTAL SCREENING ANNUALLY IN MARCH THAT IS OPEN TO RESIDENTS OF DELAWARE COUNTY. IMPROVE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH - STROKE: DELAWARE COUNTY DEATH RATE FROM STROKE IS 58.0 PER 100,000, WHICH IS GREATER THAN THE STATE DEATH RATE OF 51.1 PER 100,000 AND FAR FROM MEETING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOAL OF 48 PER 100,000. CONTINUED FOCUS ON EDUCATION, PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION IS NEEDED TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. DELAWARE COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AND CROZER-CHESTER MEDICAL CENTER HAVE JOINED AN ELITE GROUP OF HOSPITALS THAT DELIVER EXPERT STROKE CARE BY BECOMING CERTIFIED PRIMARY STROKE CENTERS CERTIFIED BY THE JOINT COMMISSION. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 400 HOSPITALS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE EARNED THIS DESIGNATION. CERTIFICATION GUIDELINES REQUIRE APPLICANTS TO HAVE A STROKE TEAM AND NEUROSURGICAL SERVICES AVAILABLE AROUND THE CLOCK, WRITTEN DIAGNOSIS AND CARE PROTOCOLS, CLOSE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND EMERGENCY TRANSPORT, AND A DEDICATED STROKE UNIT IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC CLINICAL EXPECTATIONS.</Explanation>

CKHS WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON DOMESTIC ABUSE AND ADOLESCENT VIOLENCE, THROUGH THE COLLABORATIVE WORKINGS OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HEALTHCARE ADVOCACY COALITION OF DELAWARE COUNTY AND THE CKHS/WIDENER UNIVERSITY/COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP. RESPONSIBLE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR - HIV, CHLAMYDIA, AND GONORRHEA: THE DEATH RATE FOR HIV IS HIGHER IN DELAWARE COUNTY (5.2 PER 100,000) THAN THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF PA (3.4 PER 100,000) AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 TARGET (0.7 PER 100,000).
