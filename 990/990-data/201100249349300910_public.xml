      <Description>COMMUNITY INTEGRATION: THE PAST YEAR HAS PROVIDED STEADY FLOW OF CONSUMERS IN THE PROGRAM. THE YEAR ENDED WITH 57 MALES AND 50 FEMALES IN THE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF 107 PERSONS SUPPORTED. THERE WERE 17 REFERRALS DURING THE YEAR AND 15 NEW CONSUMERS HAVE JOINED OUR PROGRAM MAKING IT A POSITIVE YEAR. THE PROGRAM SAW SLIGHT DECREASE IN OVERALL TIME SPENT IN THE COMMUNITY (27% TO 26%), THE PROGRAM HAS NOT REACHED THE GOAL OF 40% FOR EACH PERSON SUPPORTED. PLEASE NOTE THAT OVER THE PAST FISCAL YEAR, 27,875 HOURS OF COMMUNITY TIME WERE LOGGED. ACQUISITION OF SKILLS DID NOT MEET CRITERIA THIS YEAR, BUT HAVE BEEN CLOSER THAN YEARS PAST (58%) TO THE 75% MARK. STAFFING RATIOS WERE CONSISTENT WITH CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS (CONTINUED ON SCHEDULE O) AND THE BUDGET RESULTS SHOWED OUTSTANDING SUCCESS FOR THE PROGRAM. SATISFACTION OF CONSUMER AND FUNDING AND REFERRAL SOURCES WERE ALL VERY POSITIVE WITH 100% SCORING SATISFIED. THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS FORWARD TO THE YEAR AHEAD WITH MANY POSITIVE OUTCOMES TO ACHIEVE.</Description>

        <Description>ACT WORKS ENDED THE YEAR WITH 62 WORKERS (32 MALE &amp; 30 FEMALE) IN THE PROGRAM. THIS WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN AT THE END OF THE 2009 REPORTING PERIOD. THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKFORCE CONTINUES TO BE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND 54 (20 INDIVIDUALS AGES 25-34; 29 INDIVIDUALS AGES 35-54). ONLY FOUR WORKERS ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 24, AND ONLY ONE IS OVER THE AGE OF 65. THE MAJORITY OF WORKERS LIVE IN SUPPORTED ENVIRONMENTS (41), WITH SLIGHTLY OVER A THIRD (21) LIVING IN THEIR NATURAL HOMES. NINE INDIVIDUALS LEFT THE PROGRAM FOR VARIOUS REASONS (INCLUDING DEATH, INCARCERATION, GETTING ANOTHER JOB), AND NINE NEW PARTICIPANTS JOINED OUR WORKFORCE. (CONTINUED ON SCHEDULE O) THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL THIS REPORTING PERIOD WAS UP, WITH THE LARGEST GROUP (35) WORKING BETWEEN 20 AND 29 HOURS PER WEEK (LAST YEAR "BELOW 20 HOURS PER WEEK" WAS THE LARGEST CATEGORY). HOWEVER, ONLY FOUR PARTICIPANTS WORK MORE THAN 30 HOURS PER WEEK. THE ACQUISITION OF SKILLS WAS STILL WAY BELOW THE TARGETED GOAL, BUT DID INCREASE FROM 38% TO 41%. THIS AREA NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE A FOCUS FOR THE PROGRAM. STAFF RATIOS CONTINUE TO BE STRONG AND AT THE ALLOCATED RATE OF 1 TO 8. GETTING AUTHORIZATION FROM CMRO FOR NEW PARTICIPANTS TO START WORK (OR TO ADD ADDITIONAL HOURS FOR CURRENT WORKERS) CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE. AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD, THE PROGRAM WAS STILL AWAITING AUTHORIZATION FOR THREE INDIVIDUALS. ACT WORKS CONTINUES TO OPERATE AT A DEFICIT BUT WITHIN THE BUDGET TARGETS. THE TAPE DISASSEMBLY MACHINE WAS ANTICIPATED TO BE RECEIVED IN FY2010, BUT DID NOT ARRIVE; THIS IMPACTED BUDGET OUTCOMES BOTH IN TERMS OF THE GRANT MONEY FOR THE MACHINE AND THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL PROCESSED. THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD IS IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS, AT 50,927 HOURS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKER HOURS (44,872) AGAIN WERE FOCUSED ON ACT WORKS' RECYCLING EFFORTS, WITH 6055 HOURS FOCUSED ON THE GREEN DISK CONTRACT. WORKERS PROCESSED OVER 107,000 POUNDS OF PLASTIC WHICH WERE SOLD DURING FY2010. SATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES ACT WORKS PROVIDE REMAINS HIGH. 100% OF CONSUMERS INDICATED A SATISFACTION RATE OF OK OR HIGHER. 100% OF CUSTOMERS ALSO EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH PURCHASED PRODUCTS DURING THE PERIOD.</Description>

        <Description>ACT CAREER SERVICES PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO 174 JOB SEEKERS IN FY 2010. THIS IS AN INCREASE OF 33 INDIVIDUALS COMPARED WITH FY 2009. 154 INDIVIDUALS WERE FUNDED BY VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION, WHILE FIVE WERE FUNDED THROUGH THE REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR THE BLIND. 36 PEOPLE RECEIVED INDIVIDUALIZED FOLLOW-ALONG SERVICES: 16 WERE FUNDED BY BCFR, 7 WERE FUNDED BY CMRO, AND FOLLOW-ALONG SERVICES FOR 13 OF THOSE WORKERS WERE UNFUNDED. THE AGE DEMOGRAPHICS OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED IN FY2010 WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE SERVED IN FY 2009. (CONTINUED ON SCHEDULE O) CAREER SERVICES SERVED ONE INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE AGE OF 18, AND THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS AGAIN WERE EITHER YOUNG (AGED 18-24) OR MIDDLE AGED (AGED 35-54). THE MAIN DIAGNOSES OF PEOPLE SERVED WERE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, MENTAL ILLNESS, AND DUAL DIAGNOSIS. SEVEN PEOPLE WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM RECEIVED VR FUNDING (COMPARED TO FIVE LAST YEAR), WHILE SEVEN MORE HAD A DIAGNOSIS OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (COMPARED WITH SIX LAST YEAR). SIX PEOPLE WHO WERE BLIND RECEIVED SERVICES (FIVE WERE REFERRED BY RSB), AS DID 11 WHO WERE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED LIVE IN THEIR NATURAL HOME (109 OF THE 154 SERVED BY VR AND ALL FIVE REFERRED BY RSB). CAREER SERVICES RECEIVED 121 REFERRALS FROM VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION DURING THE YEAR (COMPARED WITH ONLY 51 THE PREVIOUS FY), AND 107 OF THOSE WERE SERVED. 17 INDIVIDUALS WERE RECOMMENDED FOR FOLLOW-ALONG SERVICES, AND ALL 17 WERE SERVED. INFORMATION ABOUT CONSUMERS DISCHARGED DURING FY 2010 WAS EVALUATED DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR TO GIVE A BETTER INDICATION OF WHY INDIVIDUALS WERE LEAVING SERVICE. OF THE 46 PEOPLE WHO COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS, 34 MOVED INTO JOB DEVELOPMENT AND 12 WERE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR JOB DEVELOPMENT. AN ADDITIONAL 16 STARTED BUT DID NOT COMPLETE ASSESSMENTS. THERE WAS NO SINGLE MAIN REASON GIVEN FOR THIS; REASONS INCLUDED RELOCATION, INCARCERATION, FURTHERING EDUCATION, MEDICAL CONCERNS, NON-PARTICIPATION, AND THE DECISION BY THE JOB SEEKER TO NOT PURSUE EMPLOYMENT. OF THE 53 PEOPLE WHO WERE DISCHARGED FROM JOB DEVELOPMENT, 21 WERE DUE TO OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT. 15 MORE WERE DISCHARGED FOR NON-PARTICIPATION. SIX MORE DECIDED NOT TO PURSUE EMPLOYMENT. OTHER REASONS FOR DISCHARGE INCLUDED RELOCATION (3), MEDICAL CONCERNS (3), INCARCERATION (1), AND ONE JOB SEEKER PASSED AWAY. OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED COACHING SERVICES, 23 WERE SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED AFTER 90 DAYS (VR STATUS 26), AND NINE OTHERS LOST THEIR JOB PRIOR TO THE 90-DAY CLOSURE. ALL NINE RETURNED TO JOB DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED BY THOSE WHO WERE SUCCESSFULLY PLACED IN JOBS CONTINUES TO BE LOW; THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS IS UNDER 20. THIS IS PARTLY INFLUENCED BY INDIVIDUALS NOT WANTING TO WORK MORE TIME DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING BENEFITS. STILL, 11 INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SERVED DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD WORKED OVER 30 HOURS PER WEEK. FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW THE AVERAGE WAGE FOR WORKERS CLIMBED ABOUT .40. HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE WAGE WAS STILL ONLY 8.06/HOUR. THE AVERAGE TIME LENGTH NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WAS REDUCED BY OVER THREE WEEKS TO 7.4 WEEKS. THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK TO FIND JOBS WAS CUT NEARLY IN HALF, FROM 31 WEEKS TO 16.5 WEEKS. ALTHOUGH BOTH OF THESE WERE IMPROVEMENTS, THEY STILL FELL SHORT OF THE GOALS OF SIX WEEKS FOR ASSESSMENT AND EIGHT WEEKS FOR JOB DEVELOPMENT. SATISFACTION CONTINUES TO REMAIN HIGH. JOB SEEKERS GAVE ASSESSMENT A 98% SATISFACTION RATE, JOB DEVELOPMENT HAD A 97% SATISFACTION RATE, AND TRAINING HAD A 96% SATISFACTION RATE. EMPLOYERS ALSO GAVE ACT CAREER SERVICES A 99% SATISFACTION RATE, AND 98% RATED THEIR EMPLOYEES' EFFORTS AS SATISFACTORY OR BETTER. THE LATTER IS A 7% INCREASE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AS CAREER SERVICES REVAMPED THE METHODOLOGY FOR MATCHING JOB SEEKERS AND BUSINESSES, JOB RETENTION, JOB SATISFACTION, AND EMPLOYER SATISFACTION ALL IMPROVED, WHILE THE TIME IT TOOK TO FIND JOBS DECREASED.</Description>

        <Explanation>AND THE BUDGET RESULTS SHOWED OUTSTANDING SUCCESS FOR THE PROGRAM. SATISFACTION OF CONSUMER AND FUNDING AND REFERRAL SOURCES WERE ALL VERY POSITIVE WITH 100% SCORING SATISFIED. THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS FORWARD TO THE YEAR AHEAD WITH MANY POSITIVE OUTCOMES TO ACHIEVE.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL THIS REPORTING PERIOD WAS UP, WITH THE LARGEST GROUP (35) WORKING BETWEEN 20 AND 29 HOURS PER WEEK (LAST YEAR "BELOW 20 HOURS PER WEEK" WAS THE LARGEST CATEGORY). HOWEVER, ONLY FOUR PARTICIPANTS WORK MORE THAN 30 HOURS PER WEEK. THE ACQUISITION OF SKILLS WAS STILL WAY BELOW THE TARGETED GOAL, BUT DID INCREASE FROM 38% TO 41%. THIS AREA NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE A FOCUS FOR THE PROGRAM. STAFF RATIOS CONTINUE TO BE STRONG AND AT THE ALLOCATED RATE OF 1 TO 8. GETTING AUTHORIZATION FROM CMRO FOR NEW PARTICIPANTS TO START WORK (OR TO ADD ADDITIONAL HOURS FOR CURRENT WORKERS) CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE. AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD, THE PROGRAM WAS STILL AWAITING AUTHORIZATION FOR THREE INDIVIDUALS. ACT WORKS CONTINUES TO OPERATE AT A DEFICIT BUT WITHIN THE BUDGET TARGETS. THE TAPE DISASSEMBLY MACHINE WAS ANTICIPATED TO BE RECEIVED IN FY2010, BUT DID NOT ARRIVE; THIS IMPACTED BUDGET OUTCOMES BOTH IN TERMS OF THE GRANT MONEY FOR THE MACHINE AND THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL PROCESSED. THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD IS IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS, AT 50,927 HOURS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKER HOURS (44,872) AGAIN WERE FOCUSED ON ACT WORKS' RECYCLING EFFORTS, WITH 6055 HOURS FOCUSED ON THE GREEN DISK CONTRACT. WORKERS PROCESSED OVER 107,000 POUNDS OF PLASTIC WHICH WERE SOLD DURING FY2010. SATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES ACT WORKS PROVIDE REMAINS HIGH. 100% OF CONSUMERS INDICATED A SATISFACTION RATE OF OK OR HIGHER. 100% OF CUSTOMERS ALSO EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH PURCHASED PRODUCTS DURING THE PERIOD.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>CAREER SERVICES SERVED ONE INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE AGE OF 18, AND THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS AGAIN WERE EITHER YOUNG (AGED 18-24) OR MIDDLE AGED (AGED 35-54). THE MAIN DIAGNOSES OF PEOPLE SERVED WERE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, MENTAL ILLNESS, AND DUAL DIAGNOSIS. SEVEN PEOPLE WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM RECEIVED VR FUNDING (COMPARED TO FIVE LAST YEAR), WHILE SEVEN MORE HAD A DIAGNOSIS OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (COMPARED WITH SIX LAST YEAR). SIX PEOPLE WHO WERE BLIND RECEIVED SERVICES (FIVE WERE REFERRED BY RSB), AS DID 11 WHO WERE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED LIVE IN THEIR NATURAL HOME (109 OF THE 154 SERVED BY VR AND ALL FIVE REFERRED BY RSB). CAREER SERVICES RECEIVED 121 REFERRALS FROM VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION DURING THE YEAR (COMPARED WITH ONLY 51 THE PREVIOUS FY), AND 107 OF THOSE WERE SERVED. 17 INDIVIDUALS WERE RECOMMENDED FOR FOLLOW-ALONG SERVICES, AND ALL 17 WERE SERVED. INFORMATION ABOUT CONSUMERS DISCHARGED DURING FY 2010 WAS EVALUATED DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR TO GIVE A BETTER INDICATION OF WHY INDIVIDUALS WERE LEAVING SERVICE. OF THE 46 PEOPLE WHO COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS, 34 MOVED INTO JOB DEVELOPMENT AND 12 WERE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR JOB DEVELOPMENT. AN ADDITIONAL 16 STARTED BUT DID NOT COMPLETE ASSESSMENTS. THERE WAS NO SINGLE MAIN REASON GIVEN FOR THIS; REASONS INCLUDED RELOCATION, INCARCERATION, FURTHERING EDUCATION, MEDICAL CONCERNS, NON-PARTICIPATION, AND THE DECISION BY THE JOB SEEKER TO NOT PURSUE EMPLOYMENT. OF THE 53 PEOPLE WHO WERE DISCHARGED FROM JOB DEVELOPMENT, 21 WERE DUE TO OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT. 15 MORE WERE DISCHARGED FOR NON-PARTICIPATION. SIX MORE DECIDED NOT TO PURSUE EMPLOYMENT. OTHER REASONS FOR DISCHARGE INCLUDED RELOCATION (3), MEDICAL CONCERNS (3), INCARCERATION (1), AND ONE JOB SEEKER PASSED AWAY. OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED COACHING SERVICES, 23 WERE SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED AFTER 90 DAYS (VR STATUS 26), AND NINE OTHERS LOST THEIR JOB PRIOR TO THE 90-DAY CLOSURE. ALL NINE RETURNED TO JOB DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED BY THOSE WHO WERE SUCCESSFULLY PLACED IN JOBS CONTINUES TO BE LOW; THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS IS UNDER 20. THIS IS PARTLY INFLUENCED BY INDIVIDUALS NOT WANTING TO WORK MORE TIME DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING BENEFITS. STILL, 11 INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SERVED DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD WORKED OVER 30 HOURS PER WEEK. FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW THE AVERAGE WAGE FOR WORKERS CLIMBED ABOUT .40. HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE WAGE WAS STILL ONLY 8.06/HOUR. THE AVERAGE TIME LENGTH NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WAS REDUCED BY OVER THREE WEEKS TO 7.4 WEEKS. THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK TO FIND JOBS WAS CUT NEARLY IN HALF, FROM 31 WEEKS TO 16.5 WEEKS. ALTHOUGH BOTH OF THESE WERE IMPROVEMENTS, THEY STILL FELL SHORT OF THE GOALS OF SIX WEEKS FOR ASSESSMENT AND EIGHT WEEKS FOR JOB DEVELOPMENT. SATISFACTION CONTINUES TO REMAIN HIGH. JOB SEEKERS GAVE ASSESSMENT A 98% SATISFACTION RATE, JOB DEVELOPMENT HAD A 97% SATISFACTION RATE, AND TRAINING HAD A 96% SATISFACTION RATE. EMPLOYERS ALSO GAVE ACT CAREER SERVICES A 99% SATISFACTION RATE, AND 98% RATED THEIR EMPLOYEES' EFFORTS AS SATISFACTORY OR BETTER. THE LATTER IS A 7% INCREASE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AS CAREER SERVICES REVAMPED THE METHODOLOGY FOR MATCHING JOB SEEKERS AND BUSINESSES, JOB RETENTION, JOB SATISFACTION, AND EMPLOYER SATISFACTION ALL IMPROVED, WHILE THE TIME IT TOOK TO FIND JOBS DECREASED.</Explanation>
