      <ProgramServiceAccomplishment>
        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>"UTAHNS AGAINST HUNGER WORKED TO PERSUADE FARMERS' MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ACCEPT SNAP/FOOD STAMP BENEFITS. BECAUSE OF OUR EFFORTS, IN THE 2010 MARKET SEASON, TWO ADDITIONAL MARKETS STARTING ACCEPTING SNAP/FOOD STAMPS. UAH DISCOVERED THAT MOST MARKETS LACK THE RESOURCES TO PURCHASE THE EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO ACCEPT FOOD STAMPS; AS A RESULT UAH SOUGHT AND SECURED FUNDING TO PROVIDE FOUR MARKETS WITH FUNDING TO COVER THOSE START UP COSTS. UAH IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THESE FOUR MARKETS WILL BE SELECTED, AND AFTER THEY ARE CHOSEN, WILL PROVIDE THOSE MARKETS WITH GRANTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO IMPLEMENT A FOOD STAMP PROGRAM. "UAH FACILITATES A QUARTERLY MEETING WITH ADVOCATES AND STATE FOOD STAMP ADMINISTRATORS. THESE QUARTERLY MEETING PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS EMERGING ACCESS AND POLICY ISSUES. OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 2010 IN THIS AREA INCLUDE: SECURING AN AGREEMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF WORKFORCE SERVICES (DWS) TO REEVALUATE THE WAY IN WHICH THE STATE IMPLEMENTED THE EXPANDED DEPENDENT CHILD CARE DEDUCTION IN SNAP. UTAH HAD IMPLEMENT ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS WITH A MUCH MORE NARROW FOCUS THAN NEEDED AND HAS SINCE EXPANDED THE POLICY GUIDING THIS DEDUCTION. UAH SECURED A COMMITMENT FROM DWS TO IMPLEMENT TRANSITIONAL SNAP/FOOD STAMP BENEFITS FOR FAMILIES LEAVING CASH ASSISTANCE UNDER THE REDESIGN OF THE STATE'S TANF PROGRAM. "UTAHNS AGAINST HUNGER WORKED WITH THE UTAH STATE OFFICE OF EDUCATION'S CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAM TO EXPAND THE SUMMER FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM. UAH WAS RESPONSIBLE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDING 13 NEW SUMMER FOOD SITES STATEWIDE; SEVEN OF WHICH WERE LOCATED IN RURAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AS A RESULT OF OUR WORK, A TOTAL OF 51,356 ADDITIONAL MEALS WERE PROVIDED TO UTAH CHILDREN AT THOSE SITES. IN TOTAL IN THE SUMMER OF 2009 AT ALL THE SUMMER FOOD SITES, 1,164,341 MEALS WERE SERVED, A 12 PERCENT INCREASE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. "UAH HOSTED A SEARCHABLE SUMMER FOOD PROGRAM SITE DATABASE, WHICH ALLOWED FAMILIES LOOKING FOR PROGRAM SITES TO ENTER THEIR ADDRESS AND FIND A PROGRAM SITE CLOSE TO THEIR RESIDENCE. "UAH EXPANDED OUR EFFORTS TO CREATE FOOD STAMP ACCESS SITES ACROSS UTAH. WE PARTNERED WITH MORE THAN 30 ORGANIZATIONS SERVING LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE STATE, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. EACH OF THESE SITES HAS RECEIVED A COMPUTER AND OTHER EQUIPMENT IN ORDER TO OFFER FOOD STAMP SCREENING AND THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR FOOD STAMPS AND OTHER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ONLINE. WE PROVIDED TRAINING FOR STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS IN BASIC POLICY ISSUES AND IN THE USE OF OUR ONLINE FOOD STAMP PRE-SCREENING CALCULATOR. "SCHOOL BREAKFAST EXPANSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CORE PRIORITY FOR UTAHNS AGAINST HUNGER. IN 2009 AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR NON-PARTICIPATION IN SCHOOL BREAKFAST BY LOW-INCOME CHILDREN, UAH PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY ACTION SERVICES IN PROVO AND BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY TO PILOT A SURVEY OF PARENTS OF LOW-INCOME CHILDREN AT ONE LOCAL SCHOOL WITH LOW BREAKFAST PARTICIPATION. UAH SELECTED AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE MORE THAN 75 PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS MET THE CRITERIA FOR FREE/REDUCED MEAL ELIGIBILITY, BUT ONLY ABOUT 1 IN 6 OF WHOM PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM. THE SURVEY FOCUSED ON THREE AREAS: AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM, STUDENT ATTITUDES TOWARD THE PROGRAM, AND BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY WERE INCONCLUSIVE AND SEEMED TO SUGGEST A BROAD VARIETY OF BARRIERS INCLUDING BUS SCHEDULING, STIGMA, AND A PREFERENCE TO EAT AT HOME. NEARLY ALL THOSE SURVEYED WERE AWARE OF THE PROGRAM. WE HOPE TO TAKE THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS EFFORT TO DEVISE A MORE REFINED QUESTIONNAIRE AND METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING BARRIERS IN 2010. "UTAHNS AGAINST HUNGER DISTRIBUTED 31,000 SUMMER FOOD FLIERS. FLIERS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO 65 FOOD PANTRIES AND PREPARED MEAL SITES, 30 WIC OFFICES, 34 LIBRARIES, 10 HEALTH CLINIC, HUNDREDS OF NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, AND CHURCHES, AND 25 DEPARTMENT OF WORKFORCE SERVICES (FOOD STAMP OFFICES). TEN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH LOW PERFORMING SUMMER FOOD SITES WERE TARGETED FOR OUTREACH. TEN CITIES PUBLICIZED THE SUMMER FOOD PROGRAM IN THEIR NEWSLETTERS. PRESS RELEASES WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE MEDIA THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE STATE. AS PART OF A COMBINED EFFORT WITH THE STATE OFFICE OF EDUCATION CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAM BANNERS WERE CREATED AND DISTRIBUTED TO 110 SUMMER FOOD PROGRAM SITES. "UTAHNS AGAINST HUNGER WORKED WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS DURING THE 2010 LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO ADVOCATE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS SERVING LOW-INCOME UTAH FAMILIES. AS A RESULT OF OUR ADVOCACY, STATE FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY FOOD PANTRIES WAS KEPT INTACT. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 2010 LEGISLATIVE SESSION THE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE COMMUNITY SERVICES OFFICE RECOMMENDED A 16% CUT TO STATE FUNDS THAT SUPPORT EMERGENCY FOOD PANTRIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. UTAHNS AGAINST HUNGER OPPOSED THIS CUT AND WORKED WITH STATE LEGISLATORS ON THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TO REVERSE THIS PROPOSED CUT. AS A RESULT OF OUR EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY WITH THIS COMMITTEE, FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY FOOD PANTRIES WAS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT DID NOT RECEIVE LESS FUNDING, PRESERVING MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING. UTAHNS AGAINST HUNGER WORKED WITH A COALITION OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND STATE SENATOR PAT JONES IN HER EFFORTS TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT LIMITED VENDING MACHINES AND COMPETITIVE FOODS IN SCHOOLS. "UTAHNS AGAINST HUNGER WORKED WITH UTAH'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO EDUCATE THEM ON THE ISSUES AROUND CHILD NUTRITION REAUTHORIZATION (CNR). WE PROVIDED COMMUNITY PARTNERS WITH INFORMATION AND FACT SHEETS ABOUT CNR AND SECURED SIGNATURES AND PHONE CALLS TO OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION FROM MANY OF THESE PARTNERS.</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>
