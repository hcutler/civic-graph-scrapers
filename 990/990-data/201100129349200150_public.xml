        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>Mood Disorders Programs: Facilitated iGROW interfaith teen night series with 8 congregations. The iGROW program is led by an interfaith coalition, clinicians, and peer leaders. iGROW is grounded in Bronfenbrenner's social ecological model, and informed by evidence found in the Child Health and Social Ecology (CHASE) project, where researchers demonstrated youth can successfully impart knowledge to their community, promote open and effective communication and reduce stigma. The peer leaders are volunteers from each congregation. Using the structure of the CHASE project and the recommendations for best practices from the prevention literature, the programming follows a framework of four scaffolding modules. The themes of each module are: 1) building trust, community, and common voice; 2) understanding perspectives; 3) understanding and concept development focusing on specific mental health topics; 4) taking shared social action. Peer leaders contribute by acting as liaisons in the community - sharing knowledge with peers, encouraging help seeking, and engaging community members to participate in iGROW. This model highlights youth as a critical means of engaging members of the broader community to take part in mental health prevention efforts.</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>
