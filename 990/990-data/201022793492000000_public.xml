        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>Research Project #1 - 5th to 8th Grade Students Attitudes Toward Education in Aldine and Houston ISD.The number of student's dropping out of high school continues to rise. This research sought to seek the connection between students attitude toward education and the steps needed to curtail this growing epidemic. Resolution: 1) Students appeared unknowledgeable of the connection between some of the classes taken and the future careers aspired for. 2) There was a significant difference in the attitudes for advanced education for girls over boys beginning in 7th grade, with girls having a stronger focus for advanced education. 3) Parental Participation appears to be a problem in the education arena beginning in 6th grade. Application for Students: 1) Introduce core class connectivity to show how present classes are connected to advanced degrees, thus the student's career aspirations. 2) Broaden the number of careers available in subjects students already enjoy through the introduction of careers based on subject matter or area of interest. 3) Show the connection of attitude, altitude, and aspiration to aide students in understanding the power within them to affect desired or aspired for achievements. 4) Request parental permission to have access to student records, using their record and the program activities to introduce means for parents to assist their child in achievement of their aspirations</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>Research Project #3 - The Effect of Pierre Bourdieu's Sociological Perspective Capitals in the Lives of Successful African American Female Executives. Problem: Students appear unable to adopt a clear pattern for the achieved success sought above concepts connected to "pie-in-the-sky" or "unearned success". This research sought to evaluate the connectivity of Dr. Bourdieu's Perspective Capitals to Successful Female Executives ability to aspire for and achieve success. Resolution: Each of the executives lived each aspect of Dr. Bourdieu's Capitals as a life norm adaptation with the exception of Economic Capital, which was prohibited as a result of extreme racism during their formative years. Application for Students: Introduce each Capital: Social, Symbolic, Economic, and Cultural Capital systematically as life norm adaptations with the ability to alter and correct previously learned negative and life limiting behaviors to propel students to invite opportunities to advance in all areas of their lives.</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>

        <DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>In-School Program - Caraway Intermediate School and Eisenhower Ninth Grade This program works with students deemed by school counselors as troubled, problematic, those with behavioral issues, or otherwise deemed at risk to assist students in individual evaluations of self once personality strengths and weaknesses are introduced. A facilitator of LIA meets with two different groups of girls Tuesday and Thursday at the Intermediate School and the same group on Tuesday and Thursday at the ninth grade school. LIA uses behavior modification and perception activities to assist a group of 103 young ladies in learning to proactively act in her best interest. Each step of the program introduced enhances previous steps and allows each young lady to view the progression of change in herself and her normal responses, as well as the societal expectations she will need to assist her in arriving at her envisioned, but often dismissed future destination. LIA introduces core class connectivity to careers based on subject matter to introduce the ideology of classes taken and career availability, to aide each young lady in broadening her view of future possibilities. LIA introduces Pierre Bourdieu's Sociological Perspective Capitals as the tool bridge the gap of her current modes of behavior to the societal expectations for advancement opportunities. Social Capital teaches the young ladies the significance of positive friends and associates and networking opportunities through familiar associations. Symbolic Capital teaches the young ladies the significance of club and organization affiliations in relation to career or societal interest. Economic Capital teaches the significances of effective budgeting, saving, and giving back as a life norm. And Cultural Capital makes the connection of advanced education to every other aspect of the student's external presentation. Cultural activities are added to connect each individual lesson to a practical application easily adaptable for long term instead of temporary change.</DescriptionProgramServiceAccom>
